<h2>ONCE TO EVERY MAN</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
</div>
<p>The most remarkable thing about the boy was
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;that is, if any man with his spread
of shoulder and masculine grace of flat muscled
hips could be spoken of any longer as a boy, merely
because his years happened to number twenty-four.</p>
<p>They, however&ndash;&ndash;the eyes&ndash;&ndash;were gray; not a too
light, off-color, gleaming gray, but more the tone of
slate, deep when one chanced to find oneself peering
deep into them. And they were old. Any spontaneity
of youth which might have flashed from them
at one time had faded entirely and left a sort of wistful
sophistry behind, an almost plaintive hunger which
made the pity of his shoulder-stoop&ndash;&ndash;still mercifully
only a prophecy of what the next twenty years of toil
might leave it&ndash;&ndash;an even more pitiful thing. His sheer
bigness should have been still unspoiled; instead it
was already beginning to lose its rebound; it was
growing imperceptibly slack, like the springy stride
of a colt put too soon to heavy harness.</p>
<p>Late afternoon was giving way to nightfall&ndash;&ndash;a
long shadowed twilight that was heavy with the scent
of spring in spite of the scattered patches of wet
snow that still lurked in the swamp holes. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
boy stood, facing toward the east and the town that
sprawled in the hollow, his great, shoulder-heavy
body loomed almost like a painted figure against the
cool red background of the horizon. Even in spite
of the pike-pole which he grasped in one hand and
the vividly checkered blanket coat that wrapped him,
the illusion was undeniable. Stripped of them and
equipped instead with a high steeple-crowned hat and
wide buckled shoes, his long half-saddened face and
lean body might have been a composite of all the
Puritan fathers who had wrestled with the rock-strewn
acres behind him, two hundred years and
more before.</p>
<p>Denny Bolton was waiting&ndash;&ndash;Young Denny, the
townsfolk preferred to call him, to distinguish him
from Old Denny of the former generation. Somehow,
although he had never mentioned it to anybody,
it seemed to him that he had always been waiting
for something&ndash;&ndash;he hardly knew just what it was himself&ndash;&ndash;just
something that was drearily slow in the
coming.</p>
<p>His home, the farmhouse of the Boltons, for which
the straggling village of Boltonwood below had been
named, was nearest of all the outlying places on the
post route, yet last of all to be served, for when the
rural delivery had been established they had begun
delivery at the other end of the circle. Young Denny
had never been able to understand quite why it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
so&ndash;&ndash;but it was, for all that. And with the minister,
too, it happened, although not so often, for the minister
of Boltonwood called at almost every door on
his rounds and stayed longer at each, so sometimes for
months at a time he never got around to the shabby
place on the hill at all. But the boy believed that he
did understand this and often he smiled to himself
over it, without any bitterness&ndash;&ndash;just smiled half wistfully.
He lived alone in the tumble-down old house
and did his own cooking and&ndash;&ndash;well, even a most
zealous man of the gospel might have beamed more
heartily upon better cooks than was Denny, without
any great qualms of conscience.</p>
<p>One other reason existed, or at least Young Denny
imagined that it did, but whenever he stopped to
think about it&ndash;&ndash;a thing he had come to do more and
more often in the last few months&ndash;&ndash;he never smiled.
Instead, his lips straightened until the wistful quirk
at the corners disappeared into a straight line and
his eyes smouldered ominously.</p>
<p>There was a select circle of white-haired old men&ndash;&ndash;the
village old guard&ndash;&ndash;which sat in nightly session
about the fat-bellied old wood-stove in the Boltonwood
Tavern. It convened with the first snowfall
of the winter and broke up long after the ice had
gone out in the spring; and this circle, when all other
topics had been whipped over at fever heat, until all
the zest of bitter contradiction was gone from them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
always turned at last with a delightful sort of unanimity
to the story of the night when Old Denny had
died&ndash;&ndash;the Bolton of the former generation.</p>
<p>An almost childish enthusiasm tinged their keen
relish for the tale. They squirmed and puckered
their wrinkled old faces and shivered convulsively,
just as a child might have shivered over a Bluebeard
horror, as they recalled how Old Denny had moaned
in agony one moment that night, and then screamed
horribly the next for the old stone demijohn that
always stood in the corner of the kitchen. They remembered,
with an almost astonishing wealth of
detail, that he had frothed at the mouth and blasphemed
terribly one instant, and then wept, in the
very same breath&ndash;&ndash;wept hopelessly, like the uncouth,
overgrown, frightened boy who knelt at the
bedside.</p>
<p>The strangest part of the whole thing was that not
one of them had realized at the time, or ever recalled
since, that Old Denny&#8217;s eyes were sane when he wept
that night and blurred with madness when he cursed.
But then, too, that would have smashed the dramatic
element of the whole tale to flinters. They never
missed a scene or a sob, however, in the re-telling,
and they always ended it with an ominous tilt of the
head and a little insinuating crook of the neck toward
the battered, weather-torn old house where Young
Denny had lived on alone since that last bad night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
It was very much as though they had said aloud,
&#8220;He&#8217;s the next&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll go just like the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps they never really thought of it, and perhaps
it was because Young Denny&#8217;s failure to fulfil
their prophecy had really embittered them, but the
whole village had given the boy plenty of solitude in
the last few years in which to become on terms of
thorough intimacy with the demijohn which still occupied
its place in the kitchen corner.</p>
<p>And yet that stone demijohn was almost the only
tangible reminder there was left of the Bolton who
had gone before. There were a few in the village
who wondered how, in the three intervening years,
the big silent, shambling boy had managed to tear
from his acres money enough to clear the place of
its debt&ndash;&ndash;the biggest thing by far in his heritage.
Eight hundred dollars was a large sum in Boltonwood&ndash;&ndash;and
Denny&#8217;s acres were mostly rocks. Old Denny
would have sold the last scythe and fork in the
dilapidated barn to fill the stone jug, save for the
fact that fork and scythe had themselves been too
dilapidated to find a purchaser.</p>
<p>But the same scythe had an edge now and a polish
where the boy&#8217;s hands had gripped and swung it, and
it took a flawlessly clear-grained piece of ash to
make a shaft that would stand the forkfuls of hay
which his shoulders heaved, without any apparent
effort, into the mow. The clapboards on the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
although still unpainted, no longer whined in the
wind; they were all nailed tight. And still the circle
around the stove in the Boltonwood Tavern tilted its
head&ndash;&ndash;tilted it ominously&ndash;&ndash;as if to say: &#8220;Just wait
a bit, he&#8217;ll come to it&ndash;&ndash;wait now and see!&#8221; But the
prophecy&#8217;s fulfilment, long deferred, was making
them still more bitter&ndash;&ndash;strangely bitter&ndash;&ndash;toward the
boy, who stood alone at sundown watching the road
that wound up from the village.</p>
<p>All this Young Denny knew, not because he had
been told, but because the part of him that was still
boy sensed it intuitively. He was just as happy to
be let alone, or at least so he told himself, times
without end, for it gave him a chance to sleep. And
tonight as he stood at the crest of the hill before the
dark house, waiting for Old Jerry to come along
with the mail, he was glad, too, that his place was
the last on the route. It gave him something to
look forward to during the day&ndash;&ndash;something to expect&ndash;&ndash;for
although he rarely received a letter or, to be
more exact, never, the daily newspaper was, after
all, some company. And then there were the new
farm implement catalogues and seed books, with their
dyspeptic looking fruits and vegetables. They made
better reading than nothing at all.</p>
<p>But it was not the usual bundle of papers which
came at the end of each week for which Young
Denny was waiting. Old Jerry, who drove the post
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
route, and had driven it as long as Denny could
remember, was late tonight&ndash;&ndash;he was even later than
usual for Saturday night&ndash;&ndash;and Denny&#8217;s hand
tightened nervously upon the shaft of the pike-pole
as he realized the cause of the delay.</p>
<p>For many weeks he had heard but little else mentioned
on the village streets on his infrequent trips
after groceries and grain. The winter sledding was
over; the snow had gone off a month back with the
first warm rain; just that afternoon he had made the
last trip behind his heavy team down from the big
timber back on the ridges, but during that month the
other drivers with whom he had been hauling logs
since fall had talked of nothing but the coming event.</p>
<p>From where he stood, looking out across the valley,
Young Denny could see the huge bulk of the Maynard
homestead&ndash;&ndash;Judge Maynard&#8217;s great box of a house&ndash;&ndash;silhouetted
against the skyline, and back of it high
piles of timber&ndash;&ndash;framing and sheathing for the new
barn that was going up. For Judge Maynard was
going to give a barn-raising&ndash;&ndash;an old-fashioned barn-raising
such as the hill country had not seen in twenty
years.</p>
<p>Already Young Denny knew that there were to
be two team captains who would choose from among
the best men that the country boasted, the very pick
of strength and endurance and daring. And these,
when the word was given, would swarm up with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
mallet and lock-pin over their half of the allotted
work, in the race to drive home the last spike and
wedge into place the last scantling. For days now
with a grave sort of satisfaction which he hardly
understood himself, Young Denny had time after
time put all his strength against a reluctant log, skidding
timber back on the hillside, and watched the
lithe pike-pole bend half double under the steadily
increasing strain. Somehow he felt very sure that
one or the other of the captains would single him
out; they couldn&#8217;t afford to pass him by.</p>
<p>But in that one respect only was Judge Maynard&#8217;s
barn-raising to be like those that had passed down
into history a score of years back. Every other detail,
as befitted the hospitality of the wealthiest man
in the hill country, was planned on a scale of magnificence
before unheard of, and Denny Bolton stood
and touched furtively with the tip of his tongue lips
that were dry with the glamour of it all.</p>
<p>It was to be a masquerade&ndash;&ndash;the dance which followed
on the wide, clean floors&ndash;&ndash;not the kind of a
masquerade which the church societies gave from time
to time to eke out the minister&#8217;s salary and which,
while he had never attended, Young Denny had often
heard described as &#8220;poverty-parties,&#8221; because everybody
wore the oldest of his old clothes&ndash;&ndash;but a marvelously
brilliant thing of hired costumes. It did not
mean so much to him, this last, and yet as he thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
of it his tight lips twisted into a slow smile and his
eyes swung from their hungry contemplation of the
great Maynard house to a little clump of brushwood
which made a darker blot against the black shadow
of the hill from the crest of which the Judge&#8217;s place
dominated the surrounding country. Little by little
Denny Bolton&#8217;s lean face lost its hint of hardness;
the lines that ran from his thin nose to the corners
of his lips disappeared as he smiled&ndash;&ndash;smiled with
whimsical gentleness&ndash;&ndash;at the light that glimmered
from a single window through the tangled bushes,
twinkling back at him unblinkingly.</p>
<p>There was a tiny cottage behind that light, a little
drab cottage of a half dozen rooms. It stood, unpainted
and unkempt, in a wedge-shaped acre of
neglected garden which, between high weeds and
uncut shrubbery, had long before gone to straggling
ruin. And that wedge-shaped acre which cut a deep
fissure in the edge of the immaculate pastures of
Boltonwood&#8217;s wealthiest citizen was like a barbed
thorn in Judge Maynard&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>The latter was not a judge in reality; partly the
size of the cash balance which rumor whispered he
carried at the county bank, partly the fact that he
was the only lawyer in that section, had earned him
the title. But every trick of his tricky trade which he
could invent he had brought against the owner of that
little, dilapidated cottage in a vain effort to force him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
to sell. And yet the acre of neglect and ruin still
clung like an unsightly burr to the hem of his smooth-rolling
acres.</p>
<p>The people of Boltonwood were given to calling
John Anderson a fool, and not alone because he persisted
in his senseless antagonism of a man as great
in the township as was Judge Maynard. There was
at least one other reason. It was almost twenty
years now since the day when John Anderson had
first appeared in the stern old hill town, bringing with
him a frail slip of a woman with great, moist violet-blue
eyes and tumbled yellow hair, whose very white
and gold prettiness had seemed to their puritanical
eyes the flaunting of an ungodly thing. There was
a transparent pallor in her white skin and heavy
shadows beneath her big dark eyes that made them
seem even larger and duskier. A whispered rumor
went around that she was not too strong&ndash;&ndash;that it
was the brisk keen air for which John Anderson had
brought her to the hills.</p>
<p>The little drab cottage had been white then and
there was scarcely a day but what the passers-by saw
the slender girl, in soft fluttering things that contrasted
painfully with their dingy calico, the thick
gleaming mass of hair that crowned her head wind-tossed
into her eyes, standing with her face buried
in an armful of crimson blossoms in the same garden
where the weeds were now breast high, or running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
with mad, childish abandon between the high hedgerows.
And many a night after it was too dark to
see they heard the man&#8217;s heavier bass underrunning
the light treble of her laughter which, to their sensitive
ears, was never quite free from a tinge of
mockery.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>For a year or more it was like that, and then
the day came which, with dawn, found John
Anderson changed into a gray-haired, white-faced
man, whose eyes always seemed to be looking
beyond one, and who spoke but seldom, even when
he was spoken to. During the month that followed
that night hardly a person in the village heard a
word pass his lips, except, perhaps, those members
of the church societies who had volunteered to help
care for the baby.</p>
<p>He locked himself up in the small shop which occupied
the back room of the house and day after day
he worked there alone in a deadly quiet, strangely mechanical
fashion. Sometimes far into the night they
heard the tap-tap of his mallet as he chipped away,
bit by bit, on a slender shaft of white marble, until
more than one man in those days shook his head
dubiously and vouchsafed his neighbor the information
that John Anderson &#8220;wa&#8217;n&#8217;t quite right.&#8221;</p>
<p>A month passed during which the steady chip-chip
scarcely ever ceased; and yet, when the work was
finally finished and set up over the fresh little mound
in the grounds behind the church, and they came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
stand before it, they found nothing ready for them
to say. For once the tongues of the hillsfolk were
sobered into silence.</p>
<p>It was like her&ndash;&ndash;that slim little white statue&ndash;&ndash;so
like her in its pallor and frailty of feature and limb
that they only gasped and then fell to whispering
behind their hands at the resemblance. And somehow,
too, as they stared, their faces failed to harden
as they had always hardened before, whenever they
rebuked her slim, elfish untidiness, for upon the face
of stone, which was the face of his wife, John Anderson&#8217;s
chisel had left a fleeting, poignantly wistful
smile that seemed touched with the glory of the Virgin
Mother herself.</p>
<p>They merely stood and stared&ndash;&ndash;the townsfolk&ndash;&ndash;and
yet they only half understood, for when it was
noised about the street a few days later that John
Anderson had given up forever his occupation of
chiseling tombstones for the bleak Boltonwood cemetery&ndash;&ndash;an
occupation which at least had yielded him
a bare living&ndash;&ndash;and had locked himself up in that
back room to &#8220;putter with lumps of clay,&#8221; he was
instantly convicted of being queer in the eyes of the
entire thrifty community, even without his senseless
antagonism of the Judge in the years that followed
to clinch the verdict.</p>
<p>After the first few weeks that followed that night
the village saw less and less of the man who went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
on living alone in the small white cottage with only
the child to keep him company&ndash;&ndash;the girl-child whom
he had named Dryad, perhaps in a blind, groping
hunger for beauty, perhaps in sheer revolt against
the myriad Janes and Anns and Marthas about him.
His hair was snow white before she was half grown;
he was an old man, wrinkled of face and vacant of
eye, who bent always over the bench in his back-room
shop too engrossed with his work even to note
that, day by day, her face and slim body and tumbled
yellow hair grew more and more like the face which
was always smiling up at him from the shaping clay
or marble.</p>
<p>Months passed before he opened his lips again
for speech. Then he began to talk; he began to
murmur little, disjointed intimate phrases of endearment
to the stone face growing under his fingers&ndash;&ndash;phrases
that were more than half unintelligible to
strange ears&ndash;&ndash;until as the habit grew there came long
periods, days at a time, when he carried on an uncannily
one-sided conversation with the empty air before
him, or, as the villagers often hinted, with some
one whom his eyes alone could see.</p>
<p>But as the years went by even this novelty lost its
spice with long familiarity. The cottage at the edge
of town went from straggling neglect to utter ruin,
but John Anderson still clung to it with a senseless
stubbornness over which they often shook their heads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
in pity&ndash;&ndash;in heartfelt commiseration for the Judge who
had to endure this eyesore at his very doors, in spite
of all his shrewdness or the reputed size of his balance
at the County National.</p>
<p>But if time had dimmed their interest in the father,
it had only served to whet their keen curiosity over
the girl, who, in the intervening eighteen years, had
changed from a half-starved, half-clad child that
flashed through the thickets like a wild thing, into a
long slender-limbed creature with wide, duskily violet
eyes and shimmering, tumbled hair&ndash;&ndash;a creature of
swift, passionate moods who, if they could only have
known it, was startlingly like the wild things for
which he had named her.</p>
<p>They were not given to the reading of heathen
mythology, the people of Boltonwood, and so they
could not know. But with every passing day they
did realize that Dryad Anderson&#8217;s fiercely wistful
little face was growing more and more like that of
the little statue in the grounds behind the church&ndash;&ndash;the
stone face of John Anderson&#8217;s frail bride of a
year&ndash;&ndash;long since turned a dull, nondescript gray by
the sun and weather.</p>
<p>She had the same trick of smiling with her eyes
when there was no mirth lurking in the corners of
her full lips, the same full-throated little laugh that
carried the faintest hint of mockery in its thrill. Year
by year her slim body lost its unformed boyishness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
in a new soft roundness which her long outgrown
skirt and too scant little waist failed completely
to conceal. And the hillsfolk were given to shaking
their heads over her now, just as the generation before
had done, for to cap it all&ndash;&ndash;the last straw upon the
back of their toleration&ndash;&ndash;Dryad Anderson had &#8220;took
up&#8221; with Denny Bolton, Young Denny, the last of
his name. Nothing more was needed to damn her
forever in the eyes of the hills people, although they
could not have explained just why, even if they had
tried.</p>
<p>And Young Denny, waiting there in the thickening
dusk before his own dark place, smiled gravely back
at that single blinking light in the window of the
cottage squatting under the hill&ndash;&ndash;he smiled with
whimsical gentleness, a man&#8217;s smile that softened
somehow the hard lines of jaw and lip. It was more
than three years now since the first night when he
had stood and watched for it to flash out across the
valley before he had turned and gone to set a lamp in
the dark front windows behind him in answer to it.</p>
<p>He could never remember just how they had
agreed upon that signal&ndash;&ndash;there had never been any
mutual agreement&ndash;&ndash;but every Saturday night since
that first one, three years back, he had come in from
his week&#8217;s work, ploughing or planting or teaming
back in the timber and waited for it to call to him,
just at dusk, across the valley.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>His hand went tentatively to his chin, absently caressing
his lean cheeks as he remembered that day.
Late in the afternoon he had found a rabbit caught
fast in a snare which he had set deep in the thicket,
and the little animal had squealed in terror, just as
rabbits always squeal, when he leaned and took it
from the trap. And when he had straightened to his
feet with it clutched fast in his arms, to look for a
club with which to end its struggles quickly, his eyes
had lifted to encounter the stormy eyes of the girl
who had flashed up before him as silently as a shadow
from the empty air.</p>
<p>Her two small brown fists were tight clenched
against her breast; she was breathing in short irregular
gasps as if she had been running hard.</p>
<p>At first Denny Bolton had been too amazed to do
more than stare blankly into her blazing eyes; then
before that burning glare his face began to redden
consciously and his gaze dropped, wavering from her
face to the little blouse so long outgrown that it
strained far open across the girl&#8217;s round throat,
doubly white by contrast below the brown line where
the clear tan ended.</p>
<p>His glance went down from the fierce little face to
the tight skirt, shiny from long wear and so short
that the hem hung high above her slim ankles; and
from there down to the cracked, broken shoes, string-laced
and sized too large for her fine drawn feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
They were old and patched&ndash;&ndash;the stockings&ndash;&ndash;so thickly
darned that there was little of the original fabric
left, but for all the patches there were still wide
gashes in them, fresh torn by the thorns, through
which the flesh beneath showed very white.</p>
<p>Her face colored, too, as Young Denny&#8217;s uncomfortable
scrutiny passed over her. It flamed painfully
from throat to hair and then went very white.
She tried vainly with one hand to close the gap at
her throat, while the other struggled to settle the
dingy old skirt a little lower on her childish hips.
But her hot eyes clung unwaveringly to the boy&#8217;s
face. Suddenly she lifted one hand and pointed a
quivering finger at the furry mass palpitating in his
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with it?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>Young Denny started at the question. The uncompromising
directness of the words startled him
even more than had her first swift, silent coming.
Involuntarily, spasmodically his arms closed until the
rabbit squealed again in an ecstasy of terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;I reckon to eat him!&#8221; he blurted at last,
and then his face grew hotter than ever at the baldness
of the answer.</p>
<p>It was hard to follow the change that flashed over
her face as she became conscious of his blundering,
clumsy embarrassment. It came too quickly for that,
but the angry light faded from her eyes and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
lips began to curve in the faintest of quizzical smiles.
She even forgot the too short skirt and gaping blouse
to raise both hands toward him in coaxing coquetry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let him go,&#8221; she wheedled softly. &#8220;Please
let him go&ndash;&ndash;for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny backed away a step from her upturned
face and outstretched hands, grinning a little
as he slowly shook his head. It bewildered him&ndash;&ndash;puzzled
him&ndash;&ndash;this swift change to supplication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t,&#8221; he refused laconically. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I got to have
him to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was calmly final and for no other reason
than to learn what she would do next, because already
the boy knew that the soft creature throbbing against
him was to have its freedom again. No one, at
least since he could remember, had ever before smiled
and asked Denny Bolton to &#8220;do it&ndash;&ndash;for me.&#8221; For one
flashing instant he saw her eyes flare at his candid
refusal; then they cleared again with that same miraculous
swiftness. Once more the corners of her lips
lifted pleadingly, arched with guileful, provocative
sweetness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; she begged, even more softly, &#8220;please&ndash;&ndash;because
I ask you to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more Young Denny shook his head.</p>
<p>Standing there before his dark house, still smiling
vaguely at the light across the valley his fingers tentatively
caressed his lean cheeks where her fingernails
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
had bit deep through the skin that day. He
never remembered how it had happened&ndash;&ndash;it all came
too swiftly for recollection&ndash;&ndash;but even before he had
finished shaking his head the tempting smile had been
wiped from her lips, her little face working convulsively
with rage, before she sprang at him&ndash;&ndash;sprang
with lithe, lightning, tigerlike ferocity that sent him
staggering back before her.</p>
<p>Her hands found his face and tore deep through
the skin before he could lift his wide-flung arms to
protect it. And then, almost before he realized what
had happened, she stood back, groping blindly away
from him until her hands found a birch sapling. She
clung to it with a desperately tight clasp as if to hold
herself erect. A little spot of red flecked her own lip
where her locked teeth had cut through. She swayed
a moment, dizzily, the too-tight little waist gaping at
her throat as she struggled for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&ndash;&ndash;there!&#8221; she gasped at him voicelessly.
&#8220;There,&#8221; she whispered through her white lips, &#8220;now
will you let him go?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Denny Bolton had stood that afternoon in
wondering silence, gazing back into her twitching,
distorted face without a word while the blood oozed
from the deep cuts in his cheeks and dripped noisily
upon the dry leaves. Once he turned and followed
with his eyes the mad flight of the rabbit through
the underbrush; and then turned slowly back to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s gone already,&#8221; he stated with a gentle
gravity that was almost ponderous. And with a deliberation
which he meant more to comfort than to
conciliate: &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I aimed to let him go, myself, right
from the first time you asked me&ndash;&ndash;after a while!&#8221;</p>
<p>She cried over him that afternoon&ndash;&ndash;cried not as
he had known other girls to cry, but with long noiseless
gasps that shook her thin shoulders terribly. Her
eyes swam with great drops that hung from her
lashes and went rolling silently down her small face
while she washed out the cuts with one sleeve ruthlessly
wrenched from her blouse and soaked in the
brook nearby.</p>
<p>But in almost the same breath while she crooned
pityingly over him she bade him&ndash;&ndash;commanded him
with a swift, fierce passionate vehemence&ndash;&ndash;to tell her
that it did not hurt&ndash;&ndash;did not hurt very much! And
before she would let him go that day she made him
promise to come back&ndash;&ndash;she promised herself to set
a light in the front window of the shabby little cottage
to tell him that she had found the plaster&ndash;&ndash;that
there was enough left to close the cuts.</p>
<p>There had never been any spoken agreement between
them, but since that night, three years ago,
Denny Bolton had learned to watch each week end,
just at dusk, for the signal to appear. From the
first their very loneliness had drawn them together&ndash;&ndash;a
childish, starved desire for companionship; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
as time passed they only clung the closer, each to the
other, as jealously fearful as a marooned man and
woman might have been of any harm which might
come to the one and leave the other utterly, desolately
alone.</p>
<p>Winter and summer Denny Bolton went every Saturday
night, close to nightfall, and waited for her to
come, except that now, in the last few weeks since the
first rumor of the Judge&#8217;s big barn-raising and masquerade
had gone forth, no matter how early he
started or how much haste he made, he always found
Dryad Anderson there before him. For weeks no
other topic had passed the girl&#8217;s lips, and with each
recurring visit to the small clearing hidden back in
the thicket near the brook the boy&#8217;s wonder grew.</p>
<p>Almost from the first day she had decided upon
the costume which she would wear. Night after night
she sat and made plans in a tumultuous, bubbling flood
of anticipation which he could scarcely follow, for it
was only after long argument that he had sheepishly
surrendered and agreed to &#8220;dress up&#8221; at all; she
sat with a picture torn from an old magazine across
her knees&ndash;&ndash;a color-plate of a dancing girl which she
meant to copy for herself&ndash;&ndash;poring over it with shining
eyes, her breath coming and going softly between
childishly curved lips as she devoured every detail of
its construction.</p>
<p>It was a thing of brilliantly contrasting colors&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
picture which she planned to copy&ndash;&ndash;a sleeveless
waist of dullest crimson and a much bespangled skirt
of clinging, shimmering black. And that skirt hung
clear to the ankles, swinging just high enough to
disclose the gleam of silken stockings and satiny,
pointed slippers, with heels of absurdly small girth.</p>
<p>The boy only half understood the feverish hunger
which glowed in Dryad Anderson&#8217;s face, piquantly,
wistfully earnest in the dull yellow lantern light as
she leaned forward, ticking off each item and its
probable cost upon her fingers, and waited doubtfully
for him to mock at the expense; and yet, at that, he
understood far better than any one else could ever
have hoped to comprehend, for Young Denny knew
too what it was to wait&ndash;&ndash;to wait for something that
was drearily slow in the coming.</p>
<p>One other thing marked Judge Maynard&#8217;s proffered
hospitality as totally different from all the other half-similar
affairs which Boltonwood had ever known.
There were to be invitations&ndash;&ndash;written, mailed invitations&ndash;&ndash;instead
of the usual placards tacked up in
the village post-office as they always were whenever
any public entertainment was imminent, or the haphazard
invitations which were passed along by word
of mouth and which somehow they always forgot to
pass on to the boy who lived alone in the dark house
on the hill. There were to be formal, mailed invitations,
and Young Denny found it hard waiting that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
night for Old Jerry, who had never been so late
before.</p>
<p>The cool red of the horizon behind him faded to
a dusky gray and the dusk thickened from twilight to
dark while he stood there waiting, leaning heavily
upon the pike-pole, shifting more and more uneasily
from one tired foot to the other. He had turned at
last to go and set a light in answer to the one which
was calling insistently to him from the blackness before
the Judge&#8217;s place when the shrill squeal of
complaining axles drifted up to him from far down
the long hill road.</p>
<p>Old Jerry came with exasperating slowness that
night. The plodding ascent of the fat white mare and
creaking buggy was nerve-rackingly deliberate. Young
Denny shifted the shaft of his pike-pole to the other
hand to wipe his damp palm against the checkered
coat as the rig loomed up ahead of him in the darkness.
Old Jerry was complaining to himself bitterly
in a whining, cracked falsetto.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t reg&#8217;lar,&#8221; the boy heard him whimpering.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t accordin&#8217; to law&ndash;&ndash;not the way I figger it,
it ain&#8217;t. The Gov&#8217;mint don&#8217;t expect nobody to work
&#8217;til this hour!&#8221;</p>
<p>The buggy came to a standstill, with the little,
weazened old man leaning far out from the torn
leather seat, shading his eyes with one unsteady
hand while he peered into the shadows searching for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
the big-shouldered figure that stepped hesitatingly
nearer the wheel. There was something birdlike in
the brilliancy of the beady little eyes; something of
sparrowlike pertness in the tilt of the old man&#8217;s head,
perked far over to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still a-waitin&#8217;, be ye?&#8221; he exclaimed peevishly.
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s lucky you ain&#8217;t been kept a-standin&#8217; there
a whole sight longer&ndash;&ndash;half the night, mebby! You
would a-been, only for my havin&#8217; an orig&#8217;nal system
for peddlin&#8217; them letters that&#8217;s all my own. It&#8217;s system
does it&ndash;&ndash;but it ain&#8217;t right, just the same. The
Gov&#8217;mint don&#8217;t expect nobody to work more&#8217;n eight
hours to a stretch, and look at me, two hours late
and I ain&#8217;t home yet! I&#8217;d complain, too&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d complain
to the authorities at Washington, only&ndash;&ndash;only&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his
thin, high-pitched voice dropped suddenly to a
furtively conciliating whisper&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;only a-course I don&#8217;t
want to make no trouble for the Judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny Bolton cleared his throat and shuffled his
feet uneasily, but this hint for haste was utterly
wasted upon Old Jerry. The latter failed completely
to note the strained intensity of the face that was
upturned before him and went on grumbling as he
leaned over to fumble in the box beneath the seat.
And the tirade continued in an unbroken, half-muffled
stream until he straightened laboriously again, the
boy&#8217;s usual weekly packet of papers and catalogues
in one hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he emphasized deliberately, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
really go so fur&#8217;s that&ndash;&ndash;I ain&#8217;t figgerin&#8217; on makin&#8217;
no complaint&ndash;&ndash;not this time. I got too much regard
for the Judge to try to get him into any hot water.
But there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no real use nor reason in his postin&#8217;
all them invitations to once. He could a-begun back
a stretch and kinda run &#8217;em in easy, a little to a
time, instead of lumpin&#8217; &#8217;em this way, and that would
a-give me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny reached out and took the bundle
from the extended, unsteady old hand. His own
hands were shaking a little as he broke the string
and fluttered swiftly through the half dozen papers
and pamphlets. Old Jerry never skipped a breath at
the interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that finishes up the day&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s about the
last of it.&#8221; The thin voice became heavily tinged
with pride. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nobody in the township
but what&#8217;s got his card to that barn-raising by now&ndash;&ndash;delivered
right on the nail! That&#8217;s my system.&#8221;
And then, judiciously: &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to be a
real fancy affair, too, at that. Must be it&#8217;ll cost him
more&#8217;n a little mite before he gits done feedin&#8217; &#8217;em.
They was a powerful lot of them invitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly Denny Bolton&#8217;s head lifted. He stood
and stared into Old Jerry&#8217;s peaked, wrinkled face as
if he had only half heard the rambling complaint,
a strange, bewildered light growing in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Then his gaze dropped once more, and a second time,
far more slowly, his fingers went through the packet
of advertisements. Old Jerry was leaning over to
unwind the reins from the whipstock when the boy&#8217;s
hand reached out and stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t there&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t there anything more for me&ndash;&ndash;tonight?&#8221;
Young Denny inquired gravely.</p>
<p>Jerry paused impatiently. No other question ever
caused him quite such keen irritation, for he felt that
it was a slur at his reliability.</p>
<p>&#8220;More!&#8221; he petulantly echoed the question.
&#8220;More? Why, you got your paper, ain&#8217;t you? Was
you expectin&#8217; sunthin&#8217; else? Wasn&#8217;t looking for a
letter, now was you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny backed slowly away from the wheel.
Dumbly he stood and licked his lips. He cleared his
throat again and swallowed hard before he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he faltered at last, with the same level gravity.
&#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t exactly expectin&#8217; a letter. But
I kind of thought&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I was just hopin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His grave voice trailed heavily off into silence.
Eyes still numbly bewildered he turned, leaning forward
a little, to gaze out across the valley at the
great square silhouette of Judge Maynard&#8217;s house
on the opposite ridge, while Old Jerry wheeled the
protesting buggy and started deliberately down the
hill. Just once more the latter paused; he drew the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
fat gray mare to a standstill and leaned a last time
far out from the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-course I didn&#8217;t mean nothin&#8217; when I spoke
about complainin&#8217; against the Judge,&#8221; he called back.
&#8220;You know that, don&#8217;t you, Denny? You know I
was just jokin&#8217;, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; A vaguely worried,
appealing strain crept into the cracked accents. &#8220;An&#8217;
a-course you wouldn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; about my speakin&#8217;
like that. I think a whole heap too much of the
Judge to even try to git him into trouble&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
then the Judge&ndash;&ndash;he might&ndash;&ndash;you understand that
I was only jokin&#8217;, don&#8217;t you, Denny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny nodded his head silently in reply.
Long after the shrill falsetto grumbling had ceased to
drift back up the hill to him he stood there motionless.
After a while the fingers that still clutched the
bundle of circulars opened loosely and when he did
finally wheel to cross slowly to the kitchen door the
papers and catalogues lay unheeded, scattered on the
ground where they had fallen.</p>
<p>He stopped once at the threshold to prop his pike-pole
against the house corner before he passed aimlessly
inside, leaving the door wide open behind him.
And he stood a long time in the middle of the dark
room, staring dully at the cold, fireless stove. Never
before had he given it more than a passing thought&ndash;&ndash;he
had accepted it silently as he accepted all other
conditions over which he had no control&ndash;&ndash;but now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
as he stood and stared, it came over him, bit by bit,
that he was tired&ndash;&ndash;so utterly weary that the task of
cooking his own supper that night had suddenly become
a task greater than he could even attempt.
The very thought of the half-cooked food sickened
him&ndash;&ndash;nauseated him. Motionless there in the dark
he dragged one big hand across his dry lips and
slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want me,&#8221; he muttered hoarsely.
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t because they forgot me before; they didn&#8217;t
want me&ndash;&ndash;not even for the strength of my shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>With heavy, shuffling steps he crossed and dropped
loosely into a chair beside the bare board table that
stood in front of one dingy window. A long time he
sat silent, his lean chin propped in his rough palms,
eyes burning straight ahead of him into vacancy.
Then, little by little, his great shoulders in the vividly
checkered coat began to sag&ndash;&ndash;they slumped downward-until
his head was bowed and his face lay hidden
in the long arms crooked limply asprawl across the
table-top.</p>
<p>Once more he spoke aloud, hours later.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want me,&#8221; he repeated dully. &#8220;Not
even for the work I could do!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>It was very quiet in the front room of the little
cottage that squatted in the black shadow below
Judge Maynard&#8217;s huge house on the hill. No
sound broke the heavy silence save the staccato clip-clip
of the long shears in the fingers of the girl who
was leaning almost breathlessly over the work spread
out on the table beneath the feeble glow of the single
oil-lamp, unless the faint, monotonous murmur which
came in an endless sing-song from the lips of the
stooped, white-haired old figure in the small back
room beyond the door could be named anything so
definite.</p>
<p>John Anderson&#8217;s lips always moved when he
worked. His fingers, strong and clean-jointed and
almost womanishly smooth&ndash;&ndash;the only part of the man
not pitifully seared with age&ndash;&ndash;flew with a bewildering
nimbleness one moment, only to dwell the next
with a lingering caress upon the shaping features before
him; and for each caress of his finger tips
there was an accompanying, vacantly gentle smile
or an uncertainly emphatic nod of the silvered head
which gave the one-sided conversation a touch of uncanny
reality.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>And yet, at regularly recurring intervals, even his
busy fingers faltered, while he sat head bent far over
to one side as though he were listening for something,
waiting for some reply. At every such pause the
vacant smile left his face and failed to return immediately.
The monotonously inflectionless conversation
was still, too, for the time, and he merely sat
and stared perplexedly about him, around the small
workshop, bare except for the single high-stool that
held him and the littered bench on which he leaned.</p>
<p>There was a foot-wide shelf against each wall of
that room, fastened waist high from the floor, and
upon it stood countless small white statues, all slim
and frail of limb, all upturned and smiling of lip.
They were miraculously alike, these delicate white
figures, each with a throat-tightening heartache in its
wistful face&ndash;&ndash;so alike in form and expression that
they might have been cast in a single mold. Wherever
his eyes might fall, whenever he turned in one
of those endlessly repeated fits of faltering uncertainty,
that tiny face was always before him, uplifted
of lip, smiling back into John Anderson&#8217;s vacant
eyes until his own lips began to curve again and he
turned once more, nodding his head and murmuring
contentedly, to the clay upon his bench.</p>
<p>Out in the larger front room, as she hovered over
the work spread out before her, the girl, too, was
talking aloud to herself, not in the toneless, rambling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
voice that came from John Anderson&#8217;s mumbling lips,
but in hushed, rapt, broken sentences which were softly
tinged with incredulous wonder.</p>
<p>The yellow glow of the single lamp, pushed far
across the table from her, where the most of its
radiance was swallowed up by the gloom of the uncurtained
window, flickered unsteadily across her
shining, tumbled hair, coloring the faintly blue, thinly
penciled lines beneath her tip-tilted eyes with a hint
of weariness totally at variance with the firm little
sloping shoulders and full lips, pursed in a childish
pout over a mouthful of pins.</p>
<p>The hours had passed swiftly that day for Dryad
Anderson; and the last one of all&ndash;&ndash;the one since she
had lighted the single small lamp in the room and set
it in the window, so far across the table from her
that she had to strain more and more closely over
her swift flashing scissors in the thickening dusk&ndash;&ndash;had
flown on winged feet, even faster than she knew.</p>
<p>Twice, early in the evening she had laid the long
shears aside and risen from the matter that engrossed
her almost to the exclusion of every other thought,
to peer intently out of the window across the valley
at the bleak old farmhouse on the crest of the opposite
ridge; and each time as she settled herself once
more in the chair, hunched boyishly over the table
edge, she only nodded her bright head in utter, undisturbed
unconsciousness of the passage of time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s late getting home tonight,&#8221; she told herself
aloud, after she had searched the outer darkness
in vain for any answering signal, but there was not
even the faintest trace of troubled worry in her words.
She merely smiled with mock severity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s later than he ought to be&ndash;&ndash;even if it is his
last week back in the hills. Next week I&#8217;ll have to
make him wait&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her vaguely murmured threat drifted away into
nothingness, left unfinished as she rose and stood,
hands lightly bracketed upon her hips, scrutinizing
the completed work.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she went on softly, sighing in deep relief,
&#8220;there&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s done&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;if it will only fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>She removed the cluster of pins from her mouth
and unfastened the long strip of newspaper from
the section of the old black skirt which she had ripped
apart that afternoon for a pattern. It was far too
short&ndash;&ndash;that old skirt&ndash;&ndash;to duplicate the long free lines
of the brilliant red and black costume of the dancer
beside her elbow on the table, but Dryad Anderson&#8217;s
shears, coasting rapidly around the edge of the worn
cloth, had left a wide margin of safety at the hem.</p>
<p>The critical frown upon her forehead smoothed
little by little while she lifted cautiously that long strip
of paper pattern and turned with it dangling from one
hip to walk up and down before the tilted mirror at
the far end of the room, viewing her reflected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
image from every possible angle. Even the
thoughtful pucker at the corners of her eyes disappeared
and she nodded her small head with its loosened
mass of hair in judicious satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe that&#8217;s it,&#8221; the hushed voice mused
on, &#8220;or, if it isn&#8217;t, it is as near as I can ever hope to
get it. If&ndash;&ndash;if only it doesn&#8217;t sag at the heels&ndash;&ndash;and
if it does I&#8217;ll have to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again with a last approving glance flung over one
shoulder the murmured comment, whatever it might
have been, was finished wordlessly. Her fingers, in
spite of their very smallness as strong and straight
and clean-jointed as those of the old man bent double
over his bench in the back room, lingered absently
over the folding of that last paper pattern, and when
she finally added it to the top of the stack already
folded and piled beside the lamp her eyes had become
velvety blank with preoccupation.</p>
<p>From early afternoon, ever since the Judge himself
had whirled up to the sagging gate at the end of
their rotting boardwalk and clambered out of his
yellow-wheeled buckboard to knock with measured
solemnity at the front door, Dryad had been rushing
madly from task to task and pausing always in
just such fashion in the midst of each to stand dreamily
immobile, everything else forgotten for the moment
in an effort to visualize it&ndash;&ndash;to understand that
it was real, after all, and not just a cobweb fabric
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
of her own fancy, like the dreams she was always
weaving to make the long week days pass more
quickly.</p>
<p>It was more than a few years since the last time
Judge Maynard had driven up to the gate of that
old, drab cottage; and now standing there with one
slim outstretched hand lovingly patting the bundle of
paper patterns which represented her afternoon&#8217;s
work, she smiled with gentle derision for the mental
picture she had carried all those years of the wealthiest
man in Boltonwood.</p>
<p>The paternal, almost bewildering familiar cordiality
with which he had greeted her and the pompously
jovial urgency of the invitation which he had come
to deliver in person, urging acceptance upon her because
she &#8220;saw entirely too little of the young folks
of the town,&#8221; was hardly in accord with the childish
recollection she had carried with her, year after
year, of a purple faced, cursing figure who leaned
over the rickety old fence that bounded the garden,
shook his fists in John Anderson&#8217;s mildly puzzled
face and roared threats until he had to cease from
very breathlessness.</p>
<p>A far different Judge had bowed low before her
that afternoon when she answered the measured summons
at the door&ndash;&ndash;a sleek, twinkling, unctuously solicitous,
far more portly Judge Maynard&ndash;&ndash;and Dryad
Anderson, who could not know that he had finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
come to agree with the rest of the village that he
might &#8220;catch more flies with molasses than with vinegar,&#8221;
and was ordering his campaign accordingly,
flushed in painful memory for the half-clad, half-starved
little creature that had clung to John Anderson&#8217;s
rusty coat-tails that other day and glared black,
bitter hate back at the man beyond the fence.</p>
<p>Leaning against the table there in the half light of
the room, a slow smile curled back the corners of her
lips, still childishly quizzical in contrast with that slim
roundness of body which was losing its boyish
litheness in a new slender fullness that throbbed on
the threshold of womanhood. She smiled deprecatingly
as she lifted one hand to search in the breast of
the blouse that was always just enough outgrown to
fail of closing across her throat, and drew out the
thing which the Judge had delivered with every possible
flourish, barely a few hours back.</p>
<p>Already the envelope was creased and worn with
much handling, but the square card within, thickly,
creamily white, was still unspotted. As if it were a
perishably precious thing her fingers drew it with
infinite care from its covering, and she leaned far
across the table to prop it up before her where the
light fell brightest. Pointed chin cupped in her palms,
she lay devouring with hungry eyes the words upon
its polished surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; requests the pleasure of,&#8221; she picked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
up the lines which she already knew by rote; and
then, &#8220;Miss Dryad Anderson&#8217;s company,&#8221; in the
heavy sprawling scrawl which she knew must have
come from the Judge&#8217;s own pen.</p>
<p>Suddenly her two hands flashed out and swept the
card up to crush it against her with passionate impetuosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you wonderful thing!&#8221; she crooned over it,
a low laugh that was half a sob bubbling in her throat.
&#8220;You wonderful thing! And to think that I&#8217;ve had
you all the afternoon&ndash;&ndash;almost all day&ndash;&ndash;and he&#8217;s had
to wait all this time for his to come. He&#8217;s had to
wait for Jerry to bring his with the mail&ndash;&ndash;and Jerry
is so dreadfully slow at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lingeringly, as though she hated to hide it, her
fingers thrust the card back inside its envelope. And
she was tucking it away in its warm hiding place
within the scant fullness of the white blouse when
the clock on the wall behind her began to beat out
the hour with a noisy whir of loosened cogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hours and hours,&#8221; she murmured, counting the
strokes subconsciously.</p>
<p>And then as the growing total of those gong
strokes beat in upon her brain, all the dreamy preoccupation
faded from her face. The little compassionate
smile which had accompanied the last words
disappeared before the swift, taut change that
straightened her lips. She whirled, peering from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
startled eyes up at the dim old dial, refusing to believe
her own count; and as she stood, body tensely
poised, gazing incredulously at the hands, she realized
for the first time how fast the hours had flown while
she bent, forgetful of all else, over her paper patterns.</p>
<p>The table rocked dangerously as she crowded her
body between it and the windowsill and, back to the
light, stood staring with her face cupped in her hands
out into the blackness. Far across the valley the
dilapidated farmhouse on the ridge showed only a
blurred blot against the skyline.</p>
<p>Minutes the girl stood and watched. The minutes
lengthened interminably while the light for
which she waited failed to show through the dark,
until a dead white, living fear began to creep across
her face&ndash;&ndash;a fear that wiped the last trace of childishness
from her tightened features.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s late,&#8221; she whispered hoarsely. &#8220;It&#8217;s the last
week, and it&#8217;s just kept him later than usual!&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no assurance in the words that faltered
from her lips. They were lifelessly dull, as
though she were trying to convince herself of a thing
she already knew she could not believe.</p>
<p>As long as she could she stood there at the window,
doggedly fighting the rising terror that was
bleaching her face; fighting the dread which was
never quite asleep within her brain&ndash;&ndash;the dread of that
old stone demijohn standing in the corner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
kitchen, which for all her broken pleading Young
Denny Bolton had refused with a strange, unexplained
stubbornness to remove&ndash;&ndash;until that rising terror drove
her away from the pane.</p>
<p>One wide-flung arm swept the stack of neatly folded
patterns in a rustling storm to the floor as she pushed
her way out from the narrow space between table
edge and sill. The girl did not heed them or the
lamp, that rocked drunkenly with the tottering table.
She had forgotten everything&ndash;&ndash;the thick white square
of cardboard, even the stooped old man in the small
back room&ndash;&ndash;in the face of the overwhelming fear that
reason could not fight down. Only the peculiarly absolute
silence that came with the sudden cessation of
his droning monotone checked the panic haste of her
first rush. With one hand clutching the knob of the
outer door she turned back.</p>
<p>John Anderson was sitting twisted about on his
high stool, gazing after her in infantile, perplexed
reproach, his long fingers clasped loosely about the
almost finished figure over which he had been toiling.
As the girl turned back toward him his eyes
wandered down to it and he began to shake his head
slowly, vacantly, hopelessly. A low moaning whimper
stirred her lips; then the hand tight-clenched over
the knob slackened. She ran swiftly across to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, dear?&#8221; Her voice broke, husky with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
fright and pity. &#8220;Tell me&ndash;&ndash;what is the matter?
Won&#8217;t it come right tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>With shaking hands she leaned over him, smoothing
the shining hair. At the touch of her fingers he
looked up, staring with pleading uncertainty into her
quivering face before he shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it don&#8217;t smile,&#8221; he complained querulously.
His fingers groped lightly over the small face of clay.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t make it smile&ndash;&ndash;like the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudden terror contorted the thin features, a sheer
ecstacy of terror as white-lipped as that which marred
the face of the girl who bent above him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ve forgotten how she smiled!&#8221; he whispered
fearfully. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll never be able to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dryad&#8217;s eyes flitted desperately around the room,
along the shelves laden with those countless figures&ndash;&ndash;all
white and finely slender, all upturned of face.
Again a little impotent gasp choked her; then, eyes
filling hotly at that poignantly wistful smile which
edged the lips of each, she stooped and patted reassuringly
the trembling hands before she stepped a
pace away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not forgotten, dear. Why, you mustn&#8217;t
be frightened like that! We know, you and I, don&#8217;t
we, that you never could forget? You&#8217;re just tired.
Now, that&#8217;s better&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s brave! And now&ndash;&ndash;look!
Isn&#8217;t this the way&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t this the way it ought to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Face uptilted, bloodless lips falling apart in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
faintest of pallid smiles, she swayed forward, both
arms outstretched toward him. And as she stood
the wide eyes and straight nose and delicately pointed
chin of her colorless face took line for line the lines
of all those, chalky white, against the wall.</p>
<p>For a moment John Anderson&#8217;s eyes clung to her&ndash;&ndash;clung
vacant with hopeless doubt; then they glowed
again with dawning recollection. He, too, was smiling
once more as his fingers fluttered in nervous haste
above the lips of the clay face on the bench before
him, and almost before the girl had stepped back
beside him he had forgotten that she was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie!&#8221; she heard him murmur. &#8220;Marie, why,
you mustn&#8217;t be afraid! We&#8217;ll never forget&ndash;&ndash;you and
I&ndash;&ndash;we never could forget!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even while she waited another instant those plastic
earthen lips began to curl&ndash;&ndash;they began to curve
with hungry longing like all the rest. He was talking
steadily now, mumbling broken fragments of sentences
which it was hard to understand. Her hand
hovered a moment longer over his bowed head; once
at the door she paused and looked back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only for a little while,&#8221; she promised unsteadily.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I have to go&ndash;&ndash;but it&#8217;s only for a little
while. I&#8217;ll be back soon&ndash;&ndash;so soon! And you&#8217;ll be
safe until I come!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave no sign that he had heard, not even so
much as a lifted glance. But as she drew the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
shut behind her she heard him pick up the words,
caressingly, after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be safe, Marie,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
only for a little while, now. You&#8217;ll be safe till I
come.&#8221; An ineffably peaceful smile flickered across
his face. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t forget&ndash;&ndash;why, of course, we
couldn&#8217;t forget&ndash;&ndash;you and I!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the short black skirt lifted even higher above
her ankles that she might make still more speed,
Dryad turned into the dark path that twisted crookedly
through the brush to the open clearing beside
the brook and from there on to the black house on
the hill.</p>
<p>She ran swiftly, madly, through the darkness, with
the wild, panic-stricken, headlong abandon of a
hunted thing, finding the narrow trail ahead of her
by instinct alone. Only once she overran it, but
that once a low hanging branch, face high, caught her
full across the forehead and sent her crashing back
in the underbrush. Just once she put one narrow
foot in its loosely flapping shoe into the deep crevice
between two rocks and gasped aloud with the pain
of the fall that racked her knees. When she groped
out and steadied herself erect she was talking&ndash;&ndash;stammering
half incoherent words that came bursting
jerkily from her lips as she tore on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me ... in time ... God,&#8221; she panted,
&#8220;Just this once ... get to him ... in time. Lord,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
forgive ... own vanity. Oh, God, please in time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Small feet drumming the harder ground, she flashed
up the last rise and across the yard to the door of
that unlighted kitchen. Her hands felt for the latch
and failed to find it; then she realized that it was
already open&ndash;&ndash;the door&ndash;&ndash;but her knees, all the
strength suddenly drained from them at the black quiet
in that room, refused to carry her over the threshold.
She rocked forward, reaching out with one hand for
the frame to steady herself, and in that same instant
the man who lay a huddled motionless heap across
the table top, moved a little and began to speak
aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want me,&#8221; he muttered, and the
words came with muffled thickness. &#8220;Not even for
the strength of my shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took one faltering step forward&ndash;&ndash;the girl who
stood there swaying in the doorway&ndash;&ndash;and stopped
again. And the man lifted his head and laughed softly,
a short, ugly rasping laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even for the work I could do,&#8221; he finished.</p>
<p>And then she understood. She tried to call out
to him, and the words caught in her throat and choked
her. She tried again and this time her voice rang
clear through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Denny, I&#8217;ve come to you!
Strike a light! I&#8217;m here, Denny, and&ndash;&ndash;oh, I&#8217;m afraid&ndash;&ndash;afraid
of the dark!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>Before he could rise, almost before his big-shouldered
body whirled in the chair toward her, her swift
rush carried her across to him. She knelt at his knees,
her thin arms clutching him with desperate strength.
Denny Bolton felt her body shudder violently as he
leaned over, dumb with bewilderment, and put his
hands on her bowed head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; he heard her whispering, &#8220;thank
God&ndash;&ndash;thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>But far more swiftly than his half numbed brain
could follow she was on her feet the next instant,
tense and straight and lancelike in the gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn &#8217;em,&#8221; she hissed. &#8220;Damn &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;damn &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;damn &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>His fingers felt for and found a match and struck
it. Her face was working convulsively, twisted with
hate, both small fists lifted toward the huge house
that crowned the opposite hill. It made him remember
that first day when he had looked up, with the
rabbit struggling in his arms, and found her standing
there in the thicket before him, only now the fury that
blazed in her eyes was not for him. There was a
rough red welt across her forehead only half hidden
by the tumbled hair that cascaded to her waist, torn
loose from its scant fastenings by the whipping brush.
And as he stood with the flame of the flickering match
scorching his fingers, Denny Bolton remembered all
the rest&ndash;&ndash;he remembered the light that still burned
unanswered in the window across the valley. He
bowed his head.</p>

&#8220;HOLD ME TIGHT&ndash;&ndash;OH! HOLD ME TIGHTER! FOR THEY<br />
FORGOT ME, TOO, DENNY; THEY FORGOT ME TOO!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I forgot,&#8221; he faltered at last. &#8220;I did not know
it was so late. I must have been&ndash;&ndash;pretty tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the girl&#8217;s clenched hands came away from
her throat while she stared up into his face, brown
and lean and very hard and bitter. The ashen terror
upon her own cheeks disappeared with a greater,
growing comprehension of all that lay behind that
dully colorless statement. For just a moment her
fingers hovered over the opening at the neck of her
too small blouse and felt the thick white card that lay
hidden within, before she lifted both arms to him in
impulsive compassion, trying to smile in spite of the
wearily childish droop at the corners of her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Denny,&#8221; she quavered. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I understand.&#8221;
Her arms slipped up around his neck. &#8220;Hold
me tight&ndash;&ndash;oh, hold me tighter! For they forgot me,
too, Denny; they forgot me, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>As his arms closed about her slim body she buried
her bright head against the vividly checkered coat and
sobbed silently&ndash;&ndash;great noiseless gasps that shook her
small shoulders terribly. Once, after a long time,
when she held his face away to peer up at him through
brimming eyes, she saw that all the numb bitterness
was gone from it&ndash;&ndash;that he had forgotten all else save
her own hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you mustn&#8217;t feel so badly for me,&#8221; she told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
him then, warmly tremulous of mouth. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t
mind now, very much. Only&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;her voice broke unsteadily&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;only
I did want to go just once where all
the others go; I wanted them to see me just once in
a skirt that&#8217;s long enough for me&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and to wear
stockings without any patches, and silk, Denny, silk&ndash;&ndash;next
to my skin!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>At her first swift coming when she had cried
out to him there in the dark and run across
to kneel at his knees, a dull, shamed flush
had stained his lean cheeks with the realization
that, in his own great bitterness he had failed
even to wonder whether she had been forgotten,
too.</p>
<p>Now as his big hand hovered over the tumbled
brightness of her hair, loose upon his sleeve, that hot
shame in turn disappeared. After the quivering
gasps were all but stilled, he twice opened his lips
as if to speak, and each time closed them again without
a word. He was smiling a faint, gravely gentle
smile that barely lifted the corners of his lips when
she turned in his arms and lifted her face once more
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t mind very much,&#8221; she repeated in a
half whisper. &#8220;Do we&ndash;&ndash;either of us&ndash;&ndash;now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly he shook his head. With effortless ease he
stooped and swung her up on one arm, seating her
upon the bare table before the window. Another
match flared between his fingers and the whole room
sprang into brightness as he touched the point of flame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
to the wick of the lamp bracketed to the wall beside
him.</p>
<p>She sat, leaning forward a little, both elbows resting
upon her slim knees, both feet swinging pendulum-like
high above the floor, watching with a small frown
of curiosity growing upon her forehead, while he
stooped without a word of explanation and dragged
a bulky package from the table and placed it beside
her. Then she sighed aloud, an audible sigh of sheer
surprise after he had broken the string and drawn
aside the paper wrapper.</p>
<p>Just as they had seemed in the picture they lay
there under her amazed eyes&ndash;&ndash;the pointed, satiny
black slippers of the dancing girl, with their absurdly
slender heels and brilliant buckles, and filmy stockings
to match. And underneath lay two folded squares of
shimmering stuff, dull black and burnished scarlet,
scarce thicker than the silk of the stockings themselves.</p>
<p>The faint, vaguely self-conscious smile went from
Denny Bolton&#8217;s lips while he stood and watched her
bend and touch each article, one by one&ndash;&ndash;the barest
ghost of contact. Damp eyes glowing, lips curled half
open, she lifted her head at last and gazed at him,
as he stood with hands balanced on his hips before
her.</p>
<p>A moment she sat immobile, her breath coming
and going in soft, fluttering gasps, and looked into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
his sober, questioning face; then she turned again
and picked up one web-like stocking and held it
against her cheek, as hotly tinted now beneath its
smooth whiteness as the shining scarlet cloth beside
her.</p>
<p>He heard her murmur to herself little, broken,
incoherent phrases that he could not catch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny,&#8221; he heard her whisper, &#8220;Denny&ndash;&ndash;Denny!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, with the tiny slippers huddled in her
lap, her hands flashed out and caught his face and
drew it down against the too-small white blouse, open
at the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man&ndash;&ndash;man,&#8221; she said, and he felt her breast rise
and fall, rise and fall, against his cheek. &#8220;Man, you
didn&#8217;t understand! It&ndash;&ndash;it wasn&#8217;t the clothes, Denny,
but&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m all the gladder, I think, because you&#8217;re
so much of a man that you couldn&#8217;t, not even if I
tried a hundred years to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew the chair at the side of the table around
in front of her and dropped into it. With a care
akin to reverence he lifted one slipper and held it outstretched
at arm&#8217;s length upon his broad palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I hadn&#8217;t exactly forgotten, tonight,&#8221; he told
her. &#8220;I&#8217;d watched for the light, and I meant to
bring them&ndash;&ndash;when I came.&#8221; His steady eyes dropped
to her slim, swinging feet. &#8220;They&#8217;re the smallest they had
in any shop at the county-seat,&#8221; he went on, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the slow smile came creeping back across his face. &#8220;I
crossed over through the timber late last night, after
we had broken camp, and I&ndash;&ndash;I had to guess the
size. Shall we&ndash;&ndash;try them on?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached out and snatched the small thing of
satin and leather away from him with mock jealous
impetuosity, a little reckless gurgle of utter delight
breaking from her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over these,&#8221; she demanded, lifting one foot and
pointing at the thickly patched old stocking above the
dingy, string-tied shoe. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you are trying to
shame me, Denny&ndash;&ndash;you want to make me confess they
are too small!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, almost in the same breath, all the facetious
accusation left her face. Even the warm glow of
wonder which had lighted her wet eyes gave way to
a new seriousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has ever told me,&#8221; she stated slowly, &#8220;but
I know it is so, just the same. Somehow, because it
was to be the first party I had ever attended&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;or
had a chance to attend, I thought it must be all right,
just once, for you to buy me these. There was no
one else to buy them, Denny, and maybe I wanted to
go so very much I made myself believe that it was all
right. But there isn&#8217;t any party now&ndash;&ndash;for us. And&ndash;&ndash;and
men don&#8217;t buy clothes for women, Denny&ndash;&ndash;not
until they&#8217;re married!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was tensely earnest while she waited for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the big man before her to answer. And Young Denny
turned his head, staring silently out of the opposite
window down toward the village, dark now, in the valley
below. He cleared his throat uncertainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they?&#8221; She was leaning forward until her
hair brushed his own. &#8220;Do they, Denny?&#8221; A rising
inflection left the words hanging in midair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just what the difference is,&#8221; he began
finally, his voice very deliberate. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often tried to
figure it out, and never been quite able to
get it straight&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he nodded his head again toward
the sleeping village&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;but we&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ve never been like
the rest, anyhow. And&ndash;&ndash;and anyway,&#8221; he reached
out one hand and laid it upon her knees, &#8220;we&#8217;re to
be married, too&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With swift, caressing haste she lifted the slippers
that lay cradled in her lap and set them back inside
the open package. Lightly she swung herself down
and stood before him, both hands balanced upon his
shoulders. For just the fraction of a moment her eyes
lifted over his head, flickering toward the stone demijohn
that stood in the far, shadowy corner near the
door. Her voice was trembling a little when she
went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me come soon, Denny,&#8221; she begged.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t it be soon? Oh, I&#8217;m going to keep them!&#8221;
One hand searched behind her to fall lightly upon
the package upon the table. &#8220;They&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
beautiful that I don&#8217;t believe I could ever give them
back. But do we have to wait any longer&ndash;&ndash;do we?
I can take care of him, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vehemently she tilted her head toward the little
drab cottage across under the opposite hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hardly ever notices when I come or go. I&ndash;&ndash;I
want to come, Denny. I&#8217;m lonesome, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
her eyes darkened and swam with fear as she stared
beyond him into the dusky corner near the door,
&#8220;why can&#8217;t I come now, before some time&ndash;&ndash;when
it might be&ndash;&ndash;too late?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached up and took her hands from his shoulders
and held them in front of him, absently contemplating
their rounded smoothness. She bent closer,
trying to read his eyes, and found them inscrutable.
Then his fingers tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;And be like them?&#8221; he demanded, and the words
leaped out so abruptly that they were almost harsh.
&#8220;And be like all the rest,&#8221; he reiterated, jerking his
head backward, &#8220;old and thin, and bent and worn-out
at thirty?&#8221; A hard, self-scathing note crept into
the words. &#8220;Why, it&ndash;&ndash;it took me almost a month&ndash;&ndash;even
to buy these!&#8221;</p>
<p>He in turn reached out and laid a hand upon the
bundle behind her. But she only laughed straight
back into his face&ndash;&ndash;a short, unsteady laugh of utter
derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old?&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;Work! But I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
you, Denny, wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Again she laughed in soft
disdain. &#8220;Clothes!&#8221; she scoffed. And then, more
serious even than before: &#8220;Denny, is&ndash;&ndash;is that the
only reason, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The gleam that always smoldered in Denny Bolton&#8217;s
eyes whenever he remembered the tales they told
around the Tavern stove of Old Denny&#8217;s last bad
night began to kindle. His lips were thin and straight
and as colorless as his suddenly weary face as he
stood and looked back at her. She lifted her hands
and put them back upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid&ndash;&ndash;any more&ndash;&ndash;to chance it,&#8221; she told
him, her lips trembling in spite of all she could do
to hold them steady. &#8220;I&#8217;m never afraid, when I&#8217;m with
you. It&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s only when I&#8217;m alone that it grows to be
more than I can bear, sometimes. I&#8217;m not afraid.
Does it&ndash;&ndash;does it have to stay there any longer, in
the corner, Denny? Aren&#8217;t we sure enough now&ndash;&ndash;you
and I&ndash;&ndash;aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped back a pace&ndash;&ndash;his big body huge above
her slenderness&ndash;&ndash;stepped away from the very nearness
of her. But as she lifted her arms to him he
began to shake his head&ndash;&ndash;the old stubborn refusal that
had answered her a countless number of times
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we?&#8221; she said again, but her voice sounded
very small and bodiless and forlorn in the half dark
room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>He swung one arm in a stiff gesture that embraced
the entire valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all sure, too,&#8221; his voice grated hoarsely,
&#8220;They&#8217;re all sure, too&ndash;&ndash;just as sure as we could ever
be&ndash;&ndash;and there&#8217;s a whole town of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was bending silently over the table, retying the
bundle, when he crossed back to her side, a lighted
lantern dangling in one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why myself,&#8221; he tried to explain. &#8220;I
only know I&#8217;ve got to wait. And I don&#8217;t even know
what I&#8217;m waiting for&ndash;&ndash;but I know it&#8217;s got to come!&#8221;</p>
<p>She would not lift her head when he slipped his
free arm about her shoulders and drew her against
him. When he reached out to take the package from
her she held it away from him, but her voice, half
muffled against his checkered coat, was anything but
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let <i>you</i> carry them?&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;I
wouldn&#8217;t trust them to any other hands in the world
but my own. You can&#8217;t even see them again&ndash;&ndash;not
until I&#8217;ve finished them, and I wear them&ndash;&ndash;for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With head still bowed she walked before him to
the open door. But there on the threshold she stopped
and flashed up at him her whimsically provocating
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me&ndash;&ndash;why don&#8217;t you tell me, Denny,&#8221; she
commanded imperiously, &#8220;that I&#8217;m prettier than all
the others&ndash;&ndash;even if I haven&#8217;t the pretty clothes!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>When the ridges to the east were tinged with the
red of a rising sun, Denny Bolton was still sitting,
head propped in his hands, at the table before the
window, totally oblivious to the smoking lamp beside
him, or to anything else save the square card which
he had found lying there beneath the table after he
had taken her back across the valley to John Anderson&#8217;s
once-white cottage. He rose and extinguished
the smoking wick as the first light of day began to
creep through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; requests the pleasure of Miss Dryad Anderson&#8217;s
company,&#8221; he repeated aloud. And then, as
he turned to the open door and the work that was
waiting for him, in a voice that even he himself had
never before heard pass his lips:</p>
<p>&#8220;And she could have gone&ndash;&ndash;she could have, and
she didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;just because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His grave voice drifted off into silence. As if it
were a perishably precious thing, he slipped the square
card within its envelope and buttoned the whole within
his coat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>As far back as he could remember Denny
could not recall a single day when Old Jerry
had swung up the long hill road that led to
his lonesome farmhouse on the ridge at a pace any
faster than a crawling walk. Nor could he recollect,
either, a single instance when he had chanced to arrive
at that last stop upon the route much before dark.</p>
<p>And yet it was still a good two hours before sundown;
only a few minutes before he had driven his
heavy steaming team in from the fields and turned
toward the ladder that mounted to the hayloft, when
the familiar shrill complaint of ungreased axles
drifted up to him from the valley.</p>
<p>With a foot upon the first rung Young Denny
paused, scowling in mild perplexity. He had crossed
the next moment to the open double doors, as the
sound floated up to him in a steadily increasing volume,
and was standing, his big body huge in its flannel
shirt, open at the throat, and high boots laced to
the knees, leaning loosely at ease against the door
frame, when the dingy rig with its curtains flapping
crazily in the wind lurched around the bend in the
road and came bouncing wildly up the rutty grade.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>The boy straightened and stiffened, his head going
forward a little, for the fat old mare was pounding
along at a lumbering gallop&ndash;&ndash;a pace which, in all the
time he had watched for it, he had never before beheld.
Old Jerry was driving with a magnificent abandon,
his hands far outstretched over the dash, and
more than that, for even from where he stood Denny
could hear him shouting at her in his thin, cracked
falsetto&ndash;&ndash;shouting for still more speed.</p>
<p>A rare, amused smile tugged at the corners of
Young Denny&#8217;s lips as he crossed the open yard to the
crest of the hill. But when the groaning buggy came
to a standstill and Old Jerry flung the reins across the
mare&#8217;s wide back, to dive and burrow in frantic haste
under the seat for the customary roll of advertisements,
without so much as a glance for the boy who
strode slowly up to the wheel, that shadow of a smile
which had touched his face faded into concerned gravity.
He hesitated a moment, as if not quite certain
of what he should do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there&ndash;&ndash;there isn&#8217;t any one sick, is there?&#8221; he
asked at last, half diffidently.</p>
<p>The little, white-haired old man in the buggy
jerked erect with startling, automatonlike swiftness at
that slow question. For a moment he stood absolutely
motionless, his back toward the speaker, his head
perked far over to one side as though he refused to
believe he had heard correctly. Then, little by little,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
he wheeled until his strangely brilliant, birdlike eyes
were staring straight down into Denny&#8217;s upturned,
anxious face. And as he stared Old Jerry&#8217;s countenance
grew blankly incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick!&#8221; he echoed the boy&#8217;s words scornfully.
&#8220;Sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>His grotesquely thin body seemed to swell as he
straightened himself, and his shrill squeak of a voice
took on a new note of pompous importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; he stated impressively, &#8220;I reckon, Denny,
you ain&#8217;t heard the news, hev you?&#8221; He chuckled
pityingly, half contemptuously. &#8220;I reckon you
couldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve,&#8221; he concluded with utter finality.</p>
<p>The old, sullenly bewildered light crept back into
Young Denny&#8217;s gray eyes. He shifted his feet uneasily,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I just got back down from the timber, three
days ago,&#8221; he explained, and somehow, entirely unintentionally,
as he spoke the slow statement seemed
almost an apology for his lack of information. &#8220;I
guess I haven&#8217;t heard much of anything lately&ndash;&ndash;up
here. Is it&ndash;&ndash;is it something big?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry hesitated. He felt suddenly the hopeless,
overwhelming dearth of words against which he labored
in the attempt to carry the tidings worthily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big!&#8221; He repeated the other&#8217;s question. &#8220;Big!
Why, Godfrey &#8217;Lisha, boy, it&#8217;s the biggest thing that&#8217;s
ever happened to this town. It&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s terrific! We&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
be famous&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be! In a week or two
Boltonwood&#8217;ll be as famous as&ndash;&ndash;as&ndash;&ndash;why, we&#8217;ll be
as famous as the Chicago Fair!&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off with a gasp for breath and started
fluttering madly through the paper which he had
wrenched from Young Denny&#8217;s bundle of closely
wrapped mail, until he found the page he sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;There &#8217;tis,&#8221; he cried, and pointed out a lurid headline
that ran half across the head of the sporting section.
&#8220;There &#8217;tis&ndash;&ndash;or leastwise that&#8217;s a part on it.
But they&#8217;s more a-comin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;more that that won&#8217;t be a
patch to! But you just take a look at that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny took the paper from his hand with a
sort of sober patience, and there across the first three
column heads, following the direction of Old Jerry&#8217;s
quivering forefinger, he found his first inkling of the
astounding news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed The Red wins by knockout over The Texan in
fourteenth round,&#8221; ran the red-inked caption.</p>
<p>Word by word he read it through, and a second
time his grave eyes went through it, even more painstakingly,
as though he had not caught at a single
reading all its sensational significance. Then he
looked up into the seamed old face above him, a-gleam
and a-quiver with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed The Red,&#8221; the boy said in his steady voice.
&#8220;Jed The Red!&#8221; And then, levelly: &#8220;Who&#8217;s he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry stared at him a moment before he shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
his head hopelessly and collapsed with a thud upon
the torn seat behind him, in an excess of disgust for
the boy&#8217;s stupidity which he made no effort to conceal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed who?&#8221; he mimicked, his voice shrill with sarcasm.
&#8220;Now what in time Jed would it be, if &#8217;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t
Jeddy Conway&ndash;&ndash;our own Jeddy Conway from this
very village? What other Jed is there? Ain&#8217;t you
got no memory at all, when you ought to be proud
to be able to say that you went to school with him
yourself, right in this town?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Young Denny nodded a silent agreement, but
Old Jerry&#8217;s feverish enthusiasm had carried him far
beyond mere anger at his audience&#8217;s apparent lack of
appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that ain&#8217;t all,&#8221; he rushed on breathlessly, &#8220;not
by a lot, it ain&#8217;t! That ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to compare with
what&#8217;s to come. Why, right this minute there&#8217;s a
newspaper writer down to the village&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s from
New York and he&#8217;s been stayin&#8217; to the Tavern ever
since he come in this morning and asked for a room
with a bath&ndash;&ndash;and he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to write up the town.
Yes sir-e-e&ndash;&ndash;the whole dad-blamed town! Pictures of
the main street and the old place where Jeddy went
to school, like as not, and&ndash;&ndash;and&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he hesitated for
an instant to recall the exact phrasing&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and interviews
with the older citizens who recognized his ability
and gave him a few pointers in the game when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
was only a little tad. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s to follow, and it&#8217;s
comin&#8217; out in the New York papers, too&ndash;&ndash;Sunday
supplement, colors, maybe, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudden recollection checked him in the middle of
the tumbled flow of information. Leaning far out
over the dash, he put all his slight weight against the
reins and turned the fat white mare back into the road
with astonishing celerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Godfrey, but that makes me think,&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no time to fritter away here! I got to
git down to the Tavern in a hurry. He&#8217;ll be waitin&#8217;
to hear what I kin tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thin, wrinkled old face twisted into a hopeful,
wheedling smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that, don&#8217;t you, Denny? You could tell
him that there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nobody in the hills knew little
Jeddy Conway better&#8217;n I did, couldn&#8217;t you? It&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
the last chance I&#8217;ll ever git, too, more&#8217;n likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice I missed out&ndash;&ndash;once when they found Mary
Hubbard&#8217;s husband a-hangin&#8217; to his hay mow&ndash;&ndash;a-hangin
by the very new clothes-line Mary&#8217;d just
bought the day before and ain&#8217;t ever been able to use
since on account of her feelin&#8217; somehow queer about it&ndash;&ndash;and
me laid up to home sick all the time! Everybody
else got their names mentioned in the article,
and Judge Maynard had his picture printed because
it was the Judge cut him down. &#8217;Twa&#8217;n&#8217;t fair, didn&#8217;t
seem to me, and me older&#8217;n any of &#8217;em.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And &#8217;twas just the same when they found Mrs.
Higgins&#8217;s Johnny, who had to go and git through the
ice into the crick just the one week in all the winter
when I was laid up with a bad foot from splittin&#8217;
kindling. I begun to think I wasn&#8217;t ever goin&#8217; to git
my chance&ndash;&ndash;but it&#8217;s come. It&#8217;s come at last&ndash;&ndash;and I
got to cut along and be there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he leaned over the dash and slapped the
old mare&#8217;s back with the slack of the lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git there, you,&#8221; he urged, and the complaining
buggy went lurching down the rough road at the same
unheard of pace at which it had ascended. Halfway
down the hill, after he had lifted the mare from her
shuffling fox-trot to a lumbering gallop, Old Jerry
turned back for a last shouted word.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be anxious to git all I can tell him, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221; the shrill falsetto drifted back to the boy
who had not stirred in his tracks. &#8220;No article would
be complete without that, would it? And they&#8217;s
to be pictures&ndash;&ndash;Sunday paper&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;maybe&ndash;&ndash;in
colors!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an odd light burning in Denny Bolton&#8217;s
eyes as he stood and watched the crazy conveyance
disappear from view. The half hungry, half sullen
bewilderment seemed to have given place to a new
confusion, as though all the questions which had always
been baffling him had become, all in one breath,
an astounding enigma which clamored for instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
solution. Not until the shrill scream of the ungreased
axles had died out altogether and his eyes fell once
more to the vivid streak of red that ran across the
top of the sheet still clutched in his hand did Young
Denny realize that Jerry had even failed to leave him
the rest of his mail&ndash;&ndash;the bulky package of circulars.</p>
<p>He was smiling again as he turned and went slowly
toward the back door of the house, but somehow, as
he went, the stoop of his big shoulders seemed to have
even more than the usual vague hint of weariness in
their heavy droop. He even forgot that the hungry
team which he had stabled just a few minutes before
was still unfed, as he dropped upon the top step and
spread the paper out across his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed The Red wins by knockout over The Texan in
fourteenth round,&#8221; he read again and again.</p>
<p>And then, with a slow forefinger blazing the way,
he went on through the detailed account of the latest
big heavyweight match, from the first paragraph,
which stated that &#8220;Jed Conway, having disposed of
The Texan at the Arena last night, by the knockout
route in the fourteenth round, seems to loom up as
the logical claimant of the white heavyweight title,&#8221;
to the last one of all, which pithily advised the public
that &#8220;the winner&#8217;s share of the receipts amounted to
twelve thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all couched in the choicest vocabulary of the
ringside, and more than once Young Denny, whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
literature had been confined chiefly to harvesters and
sulky plows, had to stop and decipher phrases which
he only half understood at first reading. But that
last paragraph he did not fail to grasp.</p>
<p>It grew too dark for him to make out the small
type any longer and the boy folded the paper and
laid it back across his knees. With his chin resting
upon one big palm he sat motionless, staring out beyond
his sprawling, unpainted sheds toward the dim
bulk of his hilly acres, with their jagged outcroppings
of rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve thousand dollars!&#8221; He muttered the
words aloud, under his breath. Eight hundred in
three years had seemed to him an almost miraculous
amount for him to have torn from that thin soil with
nothing but the strength of his two hands. Now,
with a bitterness that had been months in accumulating,
it beat in upon his brain with sledgelike blows
that he had paid too great a price&ndash;&ndash;too great a price
in aching shoulders and numbed thighs.</p>
<p>Methodically, mechanically, his mind went back
over the days when he had gone to school with Jed
Conway&ndash;&ndash;the same Jed The Red whom the whole
town was now welcoming as &#8220;our own Jeddy,&#8221; and
the longer he pondered the greater the problem became.</p>
<p>It was hard to understand. From his point of view
comprehension was impossible, at that instant. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
in those earlier days, when anybody had ever mentioned
Jed Conway at all, it had been only to describe
him as &#8220;good for nothing,&#8221; or something profanely
worse. Young Denny remembered him vividly as a
big, freckle-faced, bow-legged boy with red bristly
hair&ndash;&ndash;the biggest boy in the school&ndash;&ndash;who never
played but what he cheated, and always seemed able
to lie himself out of his thievery.</p>
<p>But most vividly of all, he recalled that day when
Jed Conway had disappeared from the village between
sundown and dawn and failed to return. That
was the same day they discovered the shortage in
the old wooden till at Benson&#8217;s corner store. And
now Jed Conway had come home, or at least his
fame had found its way back, and even Old Jerry,
whipping madly toward the village to share in his
reflected glory, had, for all the perfection of his
&#8220;system,&#8221; failed to leave the very bundle of mail
which he had come to deliver.</p>
<p>For a long time Young Denny sat and tried to
straighten it out in his brain&ndash;&ndash;and failed entirely. It
had grown very dark&ndash;&ndash;too dark for him to make out
the words upon it&ndash;&ndash;when he reached into the pocket
of his gray flannel shirt and drew out the card which
he had found lying upon the kitchen floor that previous
Saturday night, after he had lighted Dryad Anderson
on her way home through the thickets. But
he did not need, or even attempt, to read it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And it took me a month,&#8221; he said aloud to the
empty air before him, &#8220;almost a month to save fifteen
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose at the words, stiffly, for the chill air had
tightened his muscles, and stood a moment indecisively
contemplating the lights which were beginning to
glimmer through the dusk in the hollow, before he,
too, took the long road to the village down which Old
Jerry had rattled a scant hour or two before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The Tavern &#8220;office&#8221; was crowded and hazy
with acrid blue smoke. Behind the chairs of
the favored members of the old circle, who
always sat in nightly conclave about the stove, a long
row of men lounged against the wall, but the bitter
controversies of other nights were still. Instead, the
entire room was leaning forward, hanging breathlessly
upon the words of the short fat man who was
perched alone upon the worn desk, too engrossed even
to notice Young Denny&#8217;s entrance that night.</p>
<p>The boy stood for a moment, his hand still clasping
the knob behind him, while his eyes flickered curiously
over the heads of the crowd. Even before he
drew the door shut behind him he saw that Judge
Maynard&#8217;s chair was a good foot in advance of all
the others, directly in front of the stranger on the
desk, and that the rest of the room was furtively taking
its cue from him&ndash;&ndash;pounding its knee and laughing
immoderately whenever he laughed, or settling back
luxuriously whenever the Judge relaxed in his chair.</p>
<p>Subconsciously Young Denny realized that such
had always been the recognized order of arrangement,
ever since he could remember. The Judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
always rode in front in the parades and invariably delivered
the Fourth of July oration. Undisputed he
held the one vantage point in the room, but over his
amply broad back, as near as he dared lean, bent Old
Jerry, his thin face working with alternate hope and
half fearful uncertainty.</p>
<p>Denny Bolton would have recognized the man on
the desk as the &#8220;newspaper writer&#8221; from New York
from his clothes alone, even without the huge notebook
that was propped up on his knees for corroborative
evidence. From the soft felt hat, pushed carelessly
back from his round, good-natured face, to the
tips of his gleaming low shoes, the newcomer was a
symphony in many-toned browns. And as Young
Denny closed the door behind him he went on talking&ndash;&ndash;addressing
the entire throng before him with an
easy good-fellowship that bordered on intimate
<i>camaraderie</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the good old-fashioned stuff,&#8221; he was saying;
&#8220;the sort of thing that has always been the backbone
of the country. That is what I want it to be.
For, you see, it&#8217;s like this: We haven&#8217;t had a champion
who came from our own real old Puritan stock
in years and years like Conway has, and it&#8217;ll stir up
a whole lot of enthusiasm&ndash;&ndash;a whole lot! I want to
play that part of it up big. Now, you&#8217;re the only ones
who can give me that&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re the only men who knew
him when he was a boy&ndash;&ndash;and right there let&#8217;s make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
that a starter! What sort of a youngster was he?
Quite a handful, I should imagine&ndash;&ndash;now wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man on the desk crossed one fat knee over the
other, tapping a flat-heeled shoe with his pencil. He
tilted the brown felt hat a little farther back from his
forehead and winked one eye at the Judge in jovial
understanding. And Judge Maynard also crossed his
knees, tucked his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets,
and winked back with equal joviality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ye-e-s,&#8221; he agreed, and the agreement was
weightily deliberate. &#8220;Ye-e-s, quite a handful was
Jeddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>One pudgy hand was uplifted in sudden, deprecatory
haste, as though he would not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing really wrong, of course,&#8221; he hurried to
add with oratorical emphasis. &#8220;Nothing like that!
There never was anything mean or sneaking about
Jeddy, s&#8217;far as I can recollect. Just mischievous&ndash;&ndash;mischievous
and up and coming all the time. But
there were folks,&#8221; Judge Maynard&#8217;s voice became
heavy with righteous accusation&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it&#8217;s always that
way, you understand&ndash;&ndash;and there were folks, even
right here in Jeddy&#8217;s own village, who used to call
him a bad egg. But I&ndash;&ndash;I knew better! Nothing but
mischievousness and high spirits&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what I always
thought. And I said it, too&ndash;&ndash;many&#8217;s the time
I said&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The big shouldered boy near the door shifted his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
position a little. He leaned forward until he could
see Judge Maynard&#8217;s round, red face a little more
distinctly. There was an odd expression upon Denny
Bolton&#8217;s features when the fat man in brown lifted his
eyes from his notebook, eyes that twinkled with sympathetic
comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;That it was better a bad egg than an omelette,
eh?&#8221; he interrupted knowingly.</p>
<p>The Judge pounded his knee and rocked with
mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just about it&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s just about as
near as words could come to it,&#8221; he managed to gasp,
and the circle behind him rocked, too, and pounded
its knee as one man.</p>
<p>The man on the desk went on working industriously
with his pencil, even while he was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then I suppose he was pretty good with his
hands, too, even when he was a little shaver?&#8221; he
suggested tentatively. &#8220;But then I don&#8217;t suppose that
any one of you ever dreamed that you had a world&#8217;s
champion, right here at home, in the making, did
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole room leaned nearer. Even the late
comer near the door forgot himself entirely and took
one step forward, his narrowing gray eyes straining
upon the Judge&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Judge Maynard again weighed his reply, word for
word.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We-e-ll, no,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I
can say that I downright believed that he&#8217;d make a
world&#8217;s champion. Don&#8217;t believe&#8217;s I could truthfully
state that I thought that. But I guess there isn&#8217;t anybody
in this town that would ever deny but what I
did say more than once that he&#8217;d make the best of &#8217;em
hustle&ndash;&ndash;ye-e-s, sir, the very best of &#8217;em, some day!&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker turned to face the hushed room behind
him, as if to challenge contradiction, and Young
Denny, waiting for some one to speak, touched his
dry lips with the tip of his tongue. But no contradiction
came. Instead Old Jerry, leaning across the
Judge&#8217;s broad back, quavered breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest it&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s jest as it was&ndash;&ndash;right to a
hair. It was system done it&ndash;&ndash;system right from the
very beginning. And many&#8217;s the time the Judge says
to me&ndash;&ndash;says he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry never finished, for Judge Maynard lifted
one hand majestically and the little white-haired old
man&#8217;s eager corroboration died on his lips. He shrank
back into abashed silence, his lips working wordlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; the Judge then proceeded ponderously,
&#8220;I recognized he had what one could call&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Class?&#8221; the man on the desk broke in again with
his engaging smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; the other continued, &#8220;or, as I was
about to call it, talent. From the very first that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
very apparent, but then, of course, a man in my position
in the community could scarcely have been the
one to encourage him openly. But he was pretty
good, even as a little shaver! Why, there was nothing
among the boys that he wouldn&#8217;t tackle&ndash;&ndash;absolutely
nothing! Size, sir, never made any difference to
him&ndash;&ndash;not a particle. Jeddy Conway fight&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he turned to the close-packed circle behind
him as if mere words were too weak things to do the
question justice. And this time as he turned his eyes
met squarely those of the gray-shirted figure that was
staring straight back at him in a kind of fascination.
For one disconcerted instant Judge Maynard wavered;
he caught his breath before that level scrutiny;
then with a flourish of utter finality he threw up one
pudgy hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one of &#8217;em right now,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s
Young Denny Bolton, who went to school with him,
right here in this town. <i>Ask him</i> if Jed Conway was
pretty handy as a boy! Ask him,&#8221; he leered around
the room, an insinuating accent that was unmistakable
underrunning the words. Then a deep-throated
chuckle shook him. &#8220;But maybe he won&#8217;t tell&ndash;&ndash;maybe
he&#8217;s still a little mite too sensitive to talk about it
yet. Eh, Denny&ndash;&ndash;just a little mite too sensitive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny Bolton failed to realize it at that moment,
but there was a new quality in the Judge&#8217;s chuckling
statement&ndash;&ndash;a certain hearty admission of equality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
which he had only a second before denied to Old
Jerry&#8217;s eager endeavor to help. The eyes of the fat
man in brown lifted inquiringly from the notebook
upon his knees and followed the direction of the
Judge&#8217;s outstretched finger. He was still grinning
expansively&ndash;&ndash;and then as he saw more clearly through
the thick smoke the face which Judge Maynard was
indicating, the grin disappeared.</p>
<p>Little by little Young Denny&#8217;s body straightened
until the slight shoulder stoop had entirely vanished,
and all the while that his gaze never wavered from
the Judge&#8217;s face his eyes narrowed and his lips grew
thinner and thinner. The confused lack of understanding
was gone, too, at last, from his eyes. He even
smiled once, a fleeting, mirthless smile that tugged
at the corners of his wide mouth. For the moment
he had forgotten the circle of peering faces. The
room was very still.</p>
<p>It was the man on the desk who finally broke that
quiet, but when he spoke his voice had lost its easily
intimate good-fellowship. He spoke instead in a low-toned
directness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you went to school with Jed The Red, did
you?&#8221; he asked gravely. &#8220;Knew him when he was a
kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly Denny Bolton&#8217;s eyes traveled from the
Judge&#8217;s face. His lips opened with equal deliberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I knew him&ndash;&ndash;pretty well,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>The eyes of the man in brown were a little narrower,
too, as he nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&ndash;&ndash;had a few set-to&#8217;s with him, yourself, now
and then?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled, but even his smile was gravely direct.
Again there was a heavy silence before Young Denny
replied.</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he said, noncommittally. &#8220;Maybe
I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The throbbing silence in that room went all to bits.
Judge Maynard wheeled in his chair toward the man
on the desk and fell to pounding his knee again in
the excess of his appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he chortled, &#8220;maybe he did! Well&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;reckon!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, following his lead, the whole room rocked
with laughter in which all but the man in brown
joined. He alone, from his place on the desk, saw
that there was a white circle about the boy&#8217;s tight
mouth as Young Denny turned and fumbled with the
latch before he opened the door and passed quietly out
into the night. He alone noticed, but there was the
faintest shadow of a queer smile upon his own lips
as he turned back to the big notebook open on his
knees&ndash;&ndash;a vaguely unpleasant smile that was not in
keeping with the rotund jollity of his face.</p>
<p>For a moment Denny Bolton stood with his strained
white face turned upward, the roar in the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
behind him beating in his ears; then he turned and
went blindly up the road that wound toward the bleak
house on the hill&ndash;&ndash;he went slowly and unsteadily,
stumbling now and again in the deep ruts which it
was too dark for him to see.</p>
<p>It was only when he reached the crest of the hill,
where Old Jerry had failed to remember to leave him
his mail that afternoon, that he recalled his own
failure to feed the team with which he had been
ploughing all day back in the fields. And in the same
blind, automatic fashion he crossed and threw open
the door of the barn.</p>
<p>The interior was dark, blacker even than the thick
darkness of the night outside. Young Denny, muttering
to himself, forgot to strike a light&ndash;&ndash;he even
forgot to speak aloud to the nervous animals in the
stalls until his fingers, groping ahead of him, touched
something sleek and warm and brought him back to
himself. Then, instinctively, although it was too late,
he threw up one big shoulder to protect his face before
he was lifted and hurled crashing back against
the wall by the impact of the heavy hoofs that catapulted
out of the blackness. A moment the boy stood,
swayed sickeningly, and sank to his knees. Then he
began to think clearly again, and with one hand
clasped over the great, jagged gash which the glancing
iron shoe had laid open across his chin, he reached
up and found a cross beam and dragged himself erect.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, Tommy, whoa boy!&#8221; he soothed the dancing
horse. &#8220;Steady, it&#8217;s only me, boy!&#8221; he stammered,
and supporting himself against the wall he groped
again until he found the feedbin and finished his
day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>It was even darker in the bare kitchen when he
lurched dizzily through the door. Once as he was
feeling his way along the wall, searching for a light,
his feet stumbled on a hard rounded object against
the wainscoting, and as it toppled over its contents
ran with a slopping gurgle over the floor.</p>
<p>Then his fingers found the light. Holding himself
with one hand, he lifted the little lamp with its blackened
chimney from its bracket and raised it until it
illuminated his features reflected in the small square
mirror that hung against the wall. For a long time he
stood and looked. The blood that oozed from the
ugly bruise upon his chin was splashing in warm
drops to the floor; his face was paper white, and
strangely taut and twisted with pain, but the boy
noticed neither the one nor the other. Straight back
into his own eyes he stared&ndash;&ndash;stared steadily for all
that his big shoulders were swaying drunkenly. And
for the first time that he could ever recollect Young
Denny Bolton laughed&ndash;&ndash;laughed with real mirth.</p>
<p>He placed the smoking lamp upon the bare board
table and turned. As if they could still hear him&ndash;&ndash;the
circle about the Tavern stove in the valley below&ndash;&ndash;he
lifted both hard fists and tightened them until
the heavy muscles beneath his shirt bunched and quivered
like live things.</p>

&#8220;DRYAD, IT&#8217;S ALL RIGHT&ndash;&ndash;IT&#8217;S ALWAYS BEEN ALL RIGHT&ndash;&ndash;WITH US!<br />
THEY LIED&ndash;&ndash;THEY LIED AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE LYING!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Size never made any difference to him?&#8221; he repeated
the Judge&#8217;s word aloud, with a drawling interrogation.
&#8220;Size never made any difference to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed again, softly, as if there were a newly
discovered humor about it all which must be jealously
guarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It never had to make any difference,&#8221; the drawling
voice went on, &#8220;it didn&#8217;t have to&ndash;&ndash;because
Jed Conway was always the biggest boy in the
school!&#8221;</p>
<p>His nostrils were dilating, twitching with the thin,
sharp odor of the overturned demijohn which was
rising and thickening in the room. His eyes fell and
for the first time became conscious of it lying there at
his feet. And he stooped and picked it up, lifting it
between both hands until it was level with his face&ndash;&ndash;until
it was held at arm&#8217;s length high above his head.
Then his whole body snapped forward and the glass
from the broken window pane jingled musically on
the floor as the jug crashed out into the night.</p>
<p>Young Denny stood and smiled, one side of his
chin a gash of crimson against the dead white of his
face. Again he lifted his fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;He never whipped me,&#8221; he challenged the lights
in the hollow, &#8220;he never whipped me&ndash;&ndash;and he never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
tried but once! I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;ain&#8217;t never been&ndash;&ndash;whipped&ndash;&ndash;yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been no sound to herald her coming as
she darted up to the door. Reeling giddily there in
the middle of the room, he had not even heard the
one low cry that she choked back as she stopped at
the threshold, but he half turned that moment and
met the benumbed horror of Dryad Anderson&#8217;s eyes.
Minute after minute he merely stood and stared back
at her stupidly, while bit by bit every detail of her
transformation began to penetrate his brain, still
foggy with the force of the blow that had laid his
chin wide open. Her tumbled hair was piled high
upon her head; she was almost tall with the added
height of the high-heeled satin slippers; more slender
than ever in the bespangled clinging black skirt and
sleeveless scarlet waist which the old cloak, slipping
unheeded from her shoulders, had disclosed.</p>
<p>As his brain began to clear Young Denny forgot
the dripping blood that made his white face ghastly,
he forgot the stinging odor of the broken demijohn,
thick in the room&ndash;&ndash;forgot everything but Judge Maynard&#8217;s
face when the latter had looked up and found
him standing at the Tavern door. He knew now what
the light was that had lurked in their shifty depths;
it was fear&ndash;&ndash;fear that he&ndash;&ndash;Young Denny&ndash;&ndash;might
speak up in that moment and disclose all the hypocrisy
of his suave lies. He even failed to see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
horror in the eyes of the girl before him. Sudden, reckless
laughter rang from his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dryad,&#8221; he cried out. &#8220;Dryad, it&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
always been all right&ndash;&ndash;with us! They lied&ndash;&ndash;they lied
and they knew they were lying!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrank back, as if all the strength had been
drained from her knees, as he lurched unsteadily
across toward her and reached out his arms. But
at the touch of his hands upon her shoulders the
power of action came rushing back into her limbs.
She shuddered and whirled&ndash;&ndash;and shook off his groping
fingers. Her own hands flashed out and held his
face away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you touch me!&#8221; she panted huskily. &#8220;Oh,
you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you even dare to come near
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried to explain&ndash;&ndash;tried to follow her swift
flight as she leaped back, but his feet became entangled
in the cloak on the floor and brought him heavily to
his knees. He even tried to follow her after she had
been swallowed up in the shadows outside, until he
realized dully that his shuffling feet would not go
where his whirling head directed them. Once he
called out to her, before he staggered back to the
kitchen door, and received no answer.</p>
<p>With his hands gripping the door frame he eased
himself down to the top step and sat rocking gently
to and fro.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;all right,&#8221; he muttered once, his tongue thick
with pain. &#8220;S&#8217;always been all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he laughed aloud, a laugh of utter confidence
in spite of all its unsteadiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve thousand dollars,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and&ndash;&ndash;and he
never whipped me! He never could&ndash;&ndash;not the best
day he ever lived!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Denny Bolton never quite knew at what
hour of that long black night he reached the
final decision; there was no actual beginning
or ending or logical sequence to the argument in the
back of his brain which led up to it, to crystallize into
final resolve.</p>
<p>He merely sat there in the open door of his half-lighted
kitchen, swaying a little from side to side at
first, giddy with the pain of that crashing blow that
had laid open his chin; then balancing, motionless as
the thick shadows themselves, in a silence that was
unbroken save for the creaking night noises about
him and the rhythmic splash of the warm drops that
fell more and more slowly from the gaping, unheeded
wound, he groped back over the succession of events
of that afternoon and night, reconstructing with a sort
of dogged patience detail after detail which was
waveringly uncertain of outline, until with the clearing
of his numbed brain they stood out once again in sane,
well-ordered clarity. And as they gradually took
shape again each detail grew only more fantastically
unbelievable.</p>
<p>It seemed ages since he had stood against the closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
door of the Tavern office and seen Judge Maynard
turn and falter before his unsuspected presence&ndash;&ndash;days
and days since he had stood there and watched
that round moon-like face flush heavily with the first
shock of surprise, and realized that the startled light
in the shifty eyes of Boltonwood&#8217;s most prominent
citizen was part fear, part appeal, that he, Denny
Bolton, whose name in the estimation of that same
village stood for all that was at the other extreme,
would confirm and support his barefaced lying statement.
It was more than merely fantastic; and yet,
at that, sitting there in the dark, Young Denny still
found something in the recollection that was amusing&ndash;&ndash;far
more amusing than he had imagined anything
so simple ever could be.</p>
<p>And already, although it was scarcely hours old,
the rest of it, too, was tinged with an uncanny unreality
that was not far removed from the bodiless fabric
of nightmare itself: Those great, catapulting hoofs
which had thundered against him from the darkness
and beaten him back, a half-senseless heap, against
the barn wall; the blind, mad rage, as much a wildly
hysterical abandonment of utter joy as anything else,
which had surged through him when, with the stinging
odor of the overturned jug in his nostrils, he had
stooped and straightened and sent the old stone demijohn,
that had stood sentinel for years in the corner
near the door, splintering its way through the window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
into the night; and, last of all, the sick horror of the
girl&#8217;s face as she recoiled before him came vividly before
his eyes, and his own strange impotence of limb
and lip when he had tried to follow and found that
his feet would not obey the impulse of his brain, tried
to explain only to find that his tongue somehow refused
at that moment to voice the words he would
have spoken.</p>
<p>That was hardest of all to believe&ndash;&ndash;most difficult
to visualize&ndash;&ndash;and he would not give it full credence
until he had reached out behind him in the dark and
found the bit of a cloak which, slipping from her
shoulders, become entangled in his stumbling feet and
brought him crashing to his knees. The feel of that
rough cloth beneath his hand was more than enough
to convince him, and swiftly, unreasonably, the old
bitter tide of resentment began to creep back upon
him&ndash;&ndash;bitter resentment of her quick judgment of him,
which like that of the village, had condemned in the
years that were past, even without a hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought,&#8221; he muttered slowly aloud to himself,
&#8220;she thought I had&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He left the sentence
unfinished to drift off into a long brooding silence;
and then, many minutes later: &#8220;She didn&#8217;t even wait
to ask&ndash;&ndash;to see&ndash;&ndash;to let me tell her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>One hand went tentatively to the point of his chin&ndash;&ndash;his
old, vaguely preoccupied trick of a gesture&ndash;&ndash;and
the wet touch of that open wound helped to bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
him back to himself. A moment longer he sat, trying
to make out the stained figures that were invisible
even though he held them a scant few inches from his
eyes, before he rose, stretching his legs in experimental
doubt at first, and passed inside. And once more
he stood before the square patch of mirror on the
wall, with the small black-chimneyed lamp lifted high
in one hand, just as he had stood earlier that same
night, and scanned his own face.</p>
<p>All trace of resentment left his eyes as he realized
the ghastly pallor of those features&ndash;&ndash;all the ragged
horror of that oozing welt which he had only half
seen in that first moment when he was clinging to
consciousness with clenched teeth. It was not nice to
look at, and the light that replaced that sudden flare
of bitterness was so new that he did not even recognize
it himself at first.</p>
<p>It was a clearer, steadier, surer thing than he had
ever known them to reflect before; all hint of lost-dog
sophistication was gone; even the smile that touched
his thin, pain-straightened lips was different somehow.
It was just as whimsical as before, and just as half-mirthless&ndash;&ndash;gentle
as it always had been whenever he
thought at all of her&ndash;&ndash;but there was no wistful hunger
left in it, and little of boyishness, and nothing of
lurking self-doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she couldn&#8217;t have known,&#8221; he went on then,
still murmuring aloud. &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
expected to believe anything else. I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not much to
look at&ndash;&ndash;just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He even forgot that he had tried to follow her&ndash;&ndash;forgot
that her cloak had thrown him sprawling in the
doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have told her,&#8221; he condemned himself.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have let her go&ndash;&ndash;not like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the fullness of this new certainty of self that was
setting his pulses hammering, he even turned toward
the sleeping town, thickly blanketed by the shadows
in the valley, in a sudden boyish burst of generosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they didn&#8217;t mean to lie, either,&#8221; he mused
thoughtfully. &#8220;Maybe they haven&#8217;t really meant to
lie&ndash;&ndash;all this time. They could have been mistaken,
just as she was tonight&ndash;&ndash;they certainly could have
been that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found and filled a basin with cold water and
washed out the cut until the bleeding had stopped
entirely. And then, with the paper which that afternoon&#8217;s
mail had brought&ndash;&ndash;the sheet with the astounding
news of Jed The Red, which Old Jerry prophesied
would put Boltonwood in black letters on the map of
publicity&ndash;&ndash;spread out on the table before him, he sat
until daybreak poring over it with eyes that were
filmed with preoccupation one moment and keenly
strained the next to make out the close-set type.</p>
<p>Not long before dawn he reached inside his coat
and brought out a bit of burnished white card and set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
it up in front of him against the lamp. There was
much in the plump, black capitals and knobby script
of Judge Maynard&#8217;s invitation which was very suggestive
of the man himself, but Young Denny failed
to catch the suggestion at that moment.</p>
<p>He never quite knew when that decision became
final, nor what the mental process was which brought
it about. Nor did he even dream of the connection
there might have been between it and that square of
cardboard lying in front of him. Just once, as the
first light came streaking in through the uncurtained
window beside him, he nodded his head in deliberate,
definite finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;ve been waiting for,&#8221; he
stated, something close akin to wonder in his voice.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a man&#8217;s size chance. I&#8217;d have to take it&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d
have to do that, even if I didn&#8217;t want to&ndash;&ndash;for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And later, while he was kindling a fire in the stove
and methodically preparing his own breakfast, he
paused to add with what seemed to be absolute irrelevance:</p>
<p>&#8220;Silk&ndash;&ndash;silk, next to her skin!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were only two trains a day over the single-track
spur road that connected Boltonwood with the
outer world beyond the hills; one which left at a
most unreasonably inconvenient hour in the early
morning and one which left just as inconveniently late
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
at night. Denny Bolton, who had viewed from a distinctly
unfavorable angle any possible enchantment
which the town might chance to offer, settled upon
the first as the entirely probable choice of the short,
fat, brown-clad newspaper man, even without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation to weigh the merits of either. And
the sight of the round bulk of the latter, huddled alone
upon a baggage truck before the deserted Boltonwood
station-shed, fully vindicated his judgment.</p>
<p>It was still only a scant hour since daybreak. Heavy,
low-hanging clouds in the east, gray with threatening
rain, cut off any warmth there might have been in
the rising sun and sharpened the raw wind to a knifelike
edge. The man on the truck was too engrossed
with the thoughts that shook his plump shoulders in
regularly recurring, silent chuckles, and a ludicrously
doleful effort to shut off with upturned collar the draft
from the back of his neck, to hear the boy&#8217;s approaching
footsteps. He started guiltily to his feet in the
very middle of a spasmodic upheaval, to stand and
stare questioningly at the big figure whose fingers had
plucked tentatively at his elbow, until a sudden, delighted
recognition flooded his face. Then he reached
out one pudgy hand with eager cordiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, greetings&ndash;&ndash;greetings!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t quite recognize you with your&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;decoration.&#8221;
His eyes dwelt in frank inquisitiveness upon
the ragged red bruise across Young Denny&#8217;s chin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;re the member who stood near the door last
night, aren&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;the one who didn&#8217;t join to any
marked degree in the general jubilee?&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny&#8217;s big, hard hand closed over the outstretched
pudgy white one. He grinned a little and
slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought so,&#8221; the man in brown rambled blithely
on, &#8220;and glad to see you again. Glad of a chance to
speak to you! I wanted most mightily to ask you a
few pertinent questions last night, but it hardly seemed
a fitting occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tapped Young Denny&#8217;s arm with a stubby forefinger,
one eyelid drooping quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Entre nous</i>&ndash;&ndash;just &#8217;twixt thee and me,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;and not for publication, was this Jeddy Conway,
as you knew him, all that your eminent citizenry
would lead a poor gullible stranger to believe, or was
he just a small-sized edition of the full-blown crook
he happens to be at the present stage of developments?
Not that it makes any difference here,&#8221; he
tapped the big notebook under his arm, &#8220;but I&#8217;m just
curious, a little, because the Jed The Red whom I
happen to know is so crooked nowadays that his own
manager is afraid to place a bet on him half the time.
See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny smiled comprehendingly. He shifted his big
body to a more comfortable and far less awkward
position.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>Somehow, where it would have been an utter impossibility
to have spoken lightly to him the night
before, he found it very easy now to understand and
meet half way the frivolity of the fat, grinning man
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when he left town about eight years ago,
his going was just a trifle hasty. He&ndash;&ndash;he took about
everything there was in the cash-drawer of Benson&#8217;s
store with him&ndash;&ndash;except maybe a lead slug or two&ndash;&ndash;and
there are some who think he only overlooked
those.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gurgle of sheer delight that broke from the
lips of the man in brown was spontaneously contagious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about as your servant had it figured out last
night,&#8221; he fairly chirped. Then he slipped one hand
through the crook of Denny&#8217;s elbow. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll
have to take a chance on you. It&#8217;s too good to keep
all to myself.&#8221; He led the way back to the empty
truck. &#8220;And you ought to be safe, too, for judging
from the sentiments that were expressed after you
left last night, you&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t run very strong with
this community, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he paused, his eyelid cocked in comical suggestion.
Instead of narrowing ominously, as they
might have twelve hours before, Denny&#8217;s own eyes
lighted appreciatively at the statement. He even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
waited an instant while he pondered with mock gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he drawled finally, &#8220;that I&#8217;ll have to
confess that I&#8217;ve never been what you might call a
general favorite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newspaper man&#8217;s head lifted a little. He
flashed a covertly surprised glance at the boy&#8217;s sharp
profile. It was far from being the sort of an answer
that he had expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you certainly are not,&#8221; he emphasized, and
then he opened the flat notebook with almost loving
care across his knees.</p>
<p>Young Denny, with the first glimpse he caught of
that very first page, comprehended in one illuminating
flash the cause of those muffled chuckles which
had convulsed that rounded back when he turned the
corner of the station-shed a moment before; he even
remembered that half-veiled mirth in the eyes of the
man who had sat balanced upon the desk in the Tavern office
the night before and understood that, too.
For the hurriedly penciled sketch, which completely
filled the first page of the notebook, needed no explanation&ndash;&ndash;not
even that of the single line of writing
beneath it, which read:</p>
<p>&#8220;I always said he&#8217;d make the best of &#8217;em hustle&ndash;&ndash;yes,
sir, the very best of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a picture of Judge Maynard&ndash;&ndash;the Judge
Maynard whom Young Denny knew best of all&ndash;&ndash;unctuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
of lip and furtively calculating of eye. For
all the haste of its creation it was marvelously perfect
in detail, and as he stared the corners of the
boy&#8217;s lips began to twitch until his teeth showed white
beneath. The fat man grinned with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it, do you?&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;Get it, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And with the big-shouldered figure leaning eagerly
nearer he turned through page after page to the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad&ndash;&ndash;not bad at all,&#8221; he frankly admired his
own handiwork at the finish. &#8220;You see, it was like
this. I&#8217;ve been short on anything like this for a long
time&ndash;&ndash;good Rube stuff&ndash;&ndash;and so when Conway came
through in his match the other night it looked like
a providential opportunity&ndash;&ndash;and it certainly has
panned up to expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he turned to scan the lean face turned
toward him, far more openly, far more inquisitively,
this time. It perplexed him, bewildered him&ndash;&ndash;this
easy certainty and consciousness of power which had
replaced the lost-dog light that had driven the smile
from his own lips the night before when he had followed
Judge Maynard&#8217;s beckoning finger.</p>
<p>Hours after the enthusiastic circle about the Tavern
stove had dissolved he had labored to reproduce
that white, bitter, quivering face at the door, only to
find that the very vividness of his memory somehow
baffled the cunning of his pencil. There had been more
than mere bitterness in those curveless, colorless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
lips; something more than doubt of self behind
the white hot flare in the gray eyes. Now, in the
light of day, his eyes searched for it openly and failed
to find even a ghost of what it might have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he ruminated gently, and he spoke more to
himself than the other, &#8220;you don&#8217;t stand deuce high
with this community. You&#8217;re way down on the list.&#8221;
He hesitated, weighing his words, suddenly a little
doubtful as to how far he might safely venture. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I
guess you&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;disappointed them too long,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood surged up under Young Denny&#8217;s dark
skin until it touched his crisp black hair, and the fat
man hastened to throw a touch of jocularity into the
statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, you&#8217;ve disappointed &#8217;em sorely. But I&#8217;ve
been monopolizing all the conversation. I can&#8217;t convince
myself that you&#8217;ve come down here merely to
say me a touching farewell. Was there&ndash;&ndash;was there
something you wanted to see me about in particular?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the very opening for which Denny had been
waiting&ndash;&ndash;the opening which he had not known how
to make himself, for his plan for procedure by which
he was to accomplish it was just as indistinct as his
resolution had been final. He nodded silently, uncertain
just how to begin, and then he plunged desperately
into the very middle of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought maybe you could tell me if this was true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
or not,&#8221; he said, and he drew from his pocket the
paper which bore the account of Jed The Red&#8217;s victory
over The Texan. A hint of a frown appeared upon
the forehead of the man in brown as he took the
folded sheet and read where Denny&#8217;s finger indicated&ndash;&ndash;the
last paragraph of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The winner&#8217;s share of the receipts amounted to
twelve thousand dollars,&#8221; was its succinct burden.</p>
<p>He read it through twice, as if searching for any
puzzling phrase it might contain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly can,&#8221; he admitted at last. &#8220;I wrote it
myself, but it&#8217;s no doubt true, for all that. Not a very
big purse, of course, but then, you know, he isn&#8217;t really
championship calibre. He&#8217;s just a second-rate hopeful,
that&#8217;s all. It seems hard to find a real one these
days. But why the riddle?&#8221; he finished, as he handed
back the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought if it was true maybe I&#8217;d ask you
to tell me if I&ndash;&ndash;how I could get a chance at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s explanation was even more flounderingly
abrupt than his former question had been, but his
eyes never wavered from the newspaper man&#8217;s face.
The latter laid his notebook upon the truck with exaggerated
care and rose and faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another!&#8221; he lamented in simulated despair. But
the next moment all the bantering light went from his
face, while his eyes flashed in lightning-like appraisement
over Denny&#8217;s lean shoulder-heavy body, from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
feet, small and narrow in spite of the clumsy high
boots, to his clean-cut head, and back again. There
was a hint of businesslike eagerness in that swift calculation
of possibilities. The boy shifted consciously
under the scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that he never was able to whip me&ndash;&ndash;even
when he was a kid,&#8221; he tried to explain. &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
because I don&#8217;t believe, somehow, that he ever could.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the strained eagerness disappeared from the
face of the pudgy man in brown. He laughed softly,
a short little laugh of amusement at his own momentary
folly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting to be just
as bad as all the rest!&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt in a pocket for a card and scribbled an address
across its back. A trace of good-natured familiarity&ndash;&ndash;the
first hint of superiority that had marked
his manner&ndash;&ndash;accompanied his gesture when he extended
it in one hand. It savored of the harmless
humoring of a childish vagary.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever did chance to get as far from home as
that, there&#8217;s a man at that address who&#8217;d fall on your
neck and weep real tears if you happened to have the
stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But just one additional word. Maybe
I&#8217;ve led you astray a bit. Just because I said that
Jed The Red is a second-rater, don&#8217;t think for a moment
that he fights like a schoolboy now. He doesn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;nothing
like that!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>He gazed for another second at the boy&#8217;s thin,
grave face, so like, in its very thinness and gravity, all
that a composite of its Puritan forbears might have
been. And as he became suddenly conscious of that
resemblance he reversed the card, a whimsical twist
touching his lips, and wrote above his own name, &#8220;Introducing
the Pilgrim,&#8221; and put it in the outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any idea when you expect to make a start?&#8221; he
inquired with an elaborate negligence that brought
the hot color to the boy&#8217;s cheeks. But again, at the
words, he caught, too, a glimpse of the unshaken certainty
that backed their gray gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, I reckon. It&#8217;ll take me all of today
to get things fixed up so I can leave. I&#8217;ll take this
train in the morning. And they&ndash;&ndash;they ought to have
told you at the hotel that it&#8217;s always a half-hour late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely&ndash;&ndash;surely,&#8221; the chubby man agreed. &#8220;Nothing
like getting away with the bell. And&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
one other thing. Of course if it&#8217;s a little private affair,
I&#8217;ll bow myself gracefully out, but I do confess
to a lot of curiosity concerning that small souvenir.&#8221;
His eyes traveled to the red welt across the boy&#8217;s
chin. &#8220;May I inquire just how it happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny failed to understand him at first; then his
finger lifted and touched the wound interrogatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;This?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>The man in brown nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; the boy explained, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I kind of forgot
myself and walked in on the horses in the dark,
without speaking to them. I&#8217;d forgot to feed before
I went to the village. One of them&#8217;s young yet&ndash;&ndash;and
nervous&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The other scowled comprehendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so, just for that, they both went hungry till
you came to in the morning and found yourself
stretched out on the floor, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Young Denny puzzled a moment over the
words. He shook his head negatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o-o,&#8221; he contradicted slowly. &#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t
as bad as that. Knocked me across the floor and into
the wall and made me pretty dizzy and faint for a
little while. But I managed to feed them. I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d
worked them pretty hard in the timber last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in brown puckered his lips sympathetically,
whistling softly while he considered the damage
which that flying hoof had done, and the utter simplicity
of the explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;I wonder!&#8221;
And then, almost roughly: &#8220;Give me back
that card!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny&#8217;s eyes widened with surprise, but he
complied without a word. The man in brown stood
a moment, tapping his lips with the pencil, before he
wrote hastily under the scribbled address, cocked his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
head while he read it through, and handed it back
again.</p>
<p>The belated train was whistling for the station
crossing when he thrust out his pudgy white hand in
farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Morehouse,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been
called &#8216;Chub&#8217; by my immediate friends, a title which
is neither dignified nor reverend, and yet I answer to
it with cheerful readiness. I tell you this because I
have a premonition that we are to meet again. And
don&#8217;t lose that card!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny&#8217;s fingers closed over the outstretched
hand with a grip that brought the short, fat man in
brown up to his toes. Long after the train had crawled
out of sight the boy stood there motionless beside the
empty truck, reading over and over again the few
scrawled words that underran the line of address.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them may have science,&#8221; it read, &#8220;and
some of them may have speed, but, after all, it&#8217;s the
man that can take punishment who gets the final decision.
Call me up if this ever comes to hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which, after all, was not so cryptic as it might
have been.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>That drearily bleak day which was to witness
the temporary passing of the last of the line
of Boltons from the town which had borne
their name longer even than the oldest veteran in the
circle of regulars which nightly flanked the cracked
wood-stove in the Tavern office could recall, brought
with it a succession of thrills not second even to those
that had been occasioned by the advent of the plump
newspaper man from the metropolis, and all his promised
works.</p>
<p>And yet, so far as he himself was concerned, Young
Denny Bolton was totally oblivious, or at least apparently
so, to the very audible hum of astonishment
which ripped along behind them when they&ndash;&ndash;he and
Judge Maynard of all men&ndash;&ndash;whirled down the main
street of the village that morning through the gray
mist already heavy as fine rain, to stop with a great
flourish of glittering harness buckles and stamping of
hoofs before the post-office doors.</p>
<p>It was the busiest hour which the straggling one-story
shops along the unpaved thoroughfare knew, this
one directly following the unshuttering of the
specked, unwashed show-windows, known distinctly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
as &#8220;mail time&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a very certain instant when Old Jerry&#8217;s
measured passage from the office doors to his
dilapidated rig at the edge of the boardwalk heralded
the opening of the general delivery window within.</p>
<p>It was Old Jerry&#8217;s hour&ndash;&ndash;the one hour of the day
in which his starved appetite for notoriety ever supped
of nourishment&ndash;&ndash;that moment when the small knot of
loiterers upon the sidewalk, always, face for face,
composed of the same personnel as the unvarying
nightly circle about the Tavern stove, gave way before
him and the authority of the &#8220;Gov&#8217;mint&#8221; which he
personified.</p>
<p>Since that first morning, years back, which had
hailed his initial appearance with the mail bags slung
over one thin shoulder, he had made the most of
that daily entrance upon the stage of publicity. There
was always a haughty aloofness in his eyes that killed
any word of greeting upon the lips of these same beholders
with whom, a few hours later, he was to sit
and wrangle in bitterest intimacy; a certain brisk importance
of step which was a palpable rebuke to their
purposeless unemployment.</p>
<p>Just once this haughty reserve had been assailed.
It happened that same first morning when Old Dave
Shepard, white of head and womanishly mild of voice,
alike the circle&#8217;s patriarch and most timid member,
had stepped forward and laid one unsteady hand upon
his arm, some embarrassed word of congratulation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
trembling on his lips. Old Jerry&#8217;s bearing upon
that one occasion had precluded for all time the
possibility of its recurrence. He had stepped back a
pace, out of reach of those detaining fingers, and
fastened the offender with a stare of such baleful resentment
that the latter drew off in pitiful haste for
self-effacement. And Jerry&#8217;s words on that one occasion
were still current history.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you, Mister Shepard,&#8221; he had shrilled,
&#8220;that it&#8217;s a state&#8217;s prison offense to interfere with a
Gov&#8217;mint official in the performance of his duty&ndash;&ndash;and
if you&#8217;ve got any complaints to make they&#8217;ll have to
be set down reg&#8217;lar in writin&#8217;, so&#8217;s I can give &#8217;em due
consideration!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dating from that day Old Jerry&#8217;s daily appearance
had taken on, at least in the eyes of the Tavern regulars,
a ceremonious importance that demanded their
personal attendance, and although it still lacked a few
moments of the hour for which they were waiting, a
roll-call would have found their number complete
when the yellow-wheeled buckboard of Boltonwood&#8217;s
most important citizen, with its strangely assorted pair
of passengers, flashed into view. Denny Bolton
was totally oblivious to the stir which their appearance
created, but if he was too engrossed with
other things to be aware of the breathless hush
which followed it, the huge, moon-faced man who
occupied the seat of the buckboard with him was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
conscious of it all to a degree sufficient for both.</p>
<p>From the moment when he had himself answered
the summons at the front door of his great, boxlike
house on the hill, and found Young Denny standing
there, Judge Maynard had sensed a sensation. With
unerring judgment he read it in the very carriage of
the big-shouldered boy before him, who for the first
time in his life failed to uncover his head, with a due
amount of reverence, in the presence of the town&#8217;s
great man.</p>
<p>Perhaps with his mind set upon other things that
morning Young Denny forgot it, perhaps there was
an even deeper reason for his remissness, but the
Judge, while he stood and listened to the boy&#8217;s tersely
short explanation of his errand, was himself too taken
up with other thoughts to note the omission. He was
already formulating the rounded sentences with which
he would introduce the subject that night to the circle
in the Tavern office.</p>
<p>There was much of the dramatic in the whole situation&ndash;&ndash;much
that needed only proper staging and
elaboration to make of it a tremendous triumph, a
personal triumph, the extent of which he began to
foresee with Denny&#8217;s opening words. And the greater
became his consciousness of Denny Bolton&#8217;s strange
new bearing, the clearer he saw all the possibilities
of the situation.</p>
<p>To cap it all, the one big, irrefutable fact about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
which he could build his climax was there all ready
before him, ripe for exploitation. It was with an
actual effort of the will that the Judge held his brain
sufficiently attentive to the boy&#8217;s words to grasp the
reason for his early morning visit, in the face of the
fascination which that great, ragged bruise across
Denny&#8217;s chin had for him. Properly displayed, properly
played up, the possibilities of that raw, unbandaged
wound were incalculable, and the Judge started
almost guiltily from his greedy scrutiny of it to a
sudden realization that the boy before him had paused
in his recital and was waiting in almost insulting self-possession
for a reply.</p>
<p>Many men and some few women had rung boldly at
the Judge&#8217;s front door or, more often, tapped timidly
at the entrance in the rear of the house, all bent upon
the same errand. For it was a country-wide secret
that no one had ever been turned away from those
doors with a refusal. If any of those same visitors
ever awakened to a realization that the terms of their
bargain were far harder to bear than a refusal might
have been, they nursed that knowledge in secret.</p>
<p>The Judge was a first mortgage financier, and he
scanned each new addition to his already extensive
collection with all the elaborate care which a matcher
of precious stones might have exercised in the assembling
of a fabulous priced string of pearls. It was
his practice to scrutinize each transaction from every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
possible angle, in every degree of light and shade,
but in his eagerness that morning he forgot to don
for Denny the air of gracious understanding that was
half paternal, half deprecating, which he always wore
to set the others more at their ease. He even forgot
to clear his throat judicially when he asked the boy
before him if he had considered sufficiently the gravity
of such a step as the placing in pawn of the roof
that sheltered him and the ground that gave him food.
It may have been because Young Denny, as he stood
quietly waiting for his answer, came under neither
classification&ndash;&ndash;he was neither pitifully timid nor more
pitifully bold&ndash;&ndash;that the Judge omitted the usual pompous
formula, or merely that in his eager contemplation
of the boy&#8217;s hurt face he forgot for once his perfectly
rehearsed part.</p>
<p>No preoccupation, however, marred the businesslike
statement of his terms, but even while he named the
amount which he was willing to risk upon Young Denny&#8217;s
arid, rocky acres, and the rate of interest which
he felt compelled to demand, his brain was racing far
ahead of the matter in hand. It was the Judge himself
who engineered the half hour&#8217;s delay which resulted
in the fullest possible audience for their appearance
that morning. While he had never attended
it himself, except now and then by chance, he knew
too well the infallibility of that little knot of regulars
who watched Old Jerry&#8217;s daily departure to have any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
fears that the first of that day&#8217;s many thrills would go
unseen or unsung. And he timed their arrival to a
second.</p>
<p>Old Jerry was in the doorway, ready for his
straight-backed descent of the worn steps, when Judge
Maynard pulled his smooth gaited pair to a restive
standstill before the office and gave the reins into
Young Denny&#8217;s keeping. The throng of old men upon
the sidewalk was at the point of opening ranks to
allow him to pass through to his tattered buggy, which
stood at the roadside, a bare half-length ahead of the
Judge&#8217;s polished equipage. And now those same ranks
broke in wild disorder and then closed tighter even
than before, while they shifted and struggled for a
better view.</p>
<p>They forgot the ceremonious solemnity of the moment
and the little, birdlike figure upon the top step
trying not to show too plainly upon his face a sense
of his own importance&ndash;&ndash;they forgot everything but
the portend of the scene which the Judge was handling
in so masterful a fashion.</p>
<p>The latter&#8217;s descent from his seat to the ground
was deliberate, even for him; his silent nod to those
wide-eyed, loose-jawed old men upon the sidewalk
was the very quintessence of secretive dignity, and yet
had he taken up his position there on the corner of
the uneven boardwalk and cried aloud his sensation,
like a bally-hoo advertising the excellence of his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
particular side-show, he could not have equaled the
results which the very profundity of his silence
achieved.</p>
<p>There was a momentous promise in his gravity, a
hint of catastrophe in the tilt of his head. Like two
receding waves the tight ranks opened before him,
clearing a path for his heavy-footed advance to the
post-office doors&ndash;&ndash;a lane of bulging eyes and clicking
tongues such as Old Jerry in all his days had never
provoked. And the latter stood there stock still in the
middle of the entrance, too dazed at first to grasp the
whole meaning of the situation, until he, too, was
swept aside, without so much as a glance or a word,
by one majestic sweep of the Judge&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Old Jerry&#8217;s sparrowlike, thinly, wistful face flamed
red, and then faded a ghastly white, but no one seemed
conscious at that moment of the ignominy of it all.
It was hours later that they recalled it and realized
that they had looked upon history in the making.
No one noticed the old man&#8217;s faltering descent of
the steps, or saw that he paused in his slow way to
the buggy to turn back and stand looking about him
in a kind of bewildered desperation. For the gaze
of all had swung from the Judge&#8217;s broad, disappearing
back to the face of the boy who was sitting in the
buckboard, totally unconscious of that battery of eyes,
smiling to himself.</p>
<p>He even chuckled aloud once&ndash;&ndash;Young Denny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
did&ndash;&ndash;a muffled, reasonless sort of a chuckle, as if he did
not even know they were there. It was almost as
though he were playing straight into the Judge&#8217;s own
plan, for the effect of the mirth upon the group on
the walk was electrical. It sent a shiver of anticipation
through it from end to end. And then, like the
eyes of one man, their eyes swung back again from
the ragged bruise across the boy&#8217;s chin to meet the
Judge as he reappeared.</p>
<p>Yet not one of them so much as dared to whisper
the question that was quivering upon the lips of all
and burning hungrily in their faded eyes. Once more
the wide lane opened magically for him&ndash;&ndash;but again
Judge Maynard&#8217;s measured progress was momentarily
barred. Curiosity may have prompted it, and then
again it may have been that he was betrayed by the
very fury of his desperate, eleventh hour effort to
assert his right to the center of that stage&ndash;&ndash;the right
of long-established precedent&ndash;&ndash;yet even those two
long files of old men gasped aloud their dismay at his
temerity when Old Jerry thrust his way forward and
planted himself for a second time squarely in the
great man&#8217;s path.</p>
<p>Half way from the office doors to the yellow-wheeled
buckboard, in the very middle of the walk,
he stood and stretched out a tentatively restraining
hand, just as mild-voiced, white-haired Dave had done
years before. And in his high, cracked falsetto, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
was tremulously bitter for all that he struggled to lift
it to a plane of easy jocularity, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Jedge; what&#8217;s the meanin&#8217; of all
this? You ain&#8217;t turned kidnapper, hev you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a heavy hush, while the Judge stood
and stared down at the thin face trying to smile confidently
up at him&ndash;&ndash;a hush that endured while Judge
Maynard swept him from head to foot with one
shriveling glare and then walked around him without
a word&ndash;&ndash;walked around him just as he might
have walked around the hitching post at the roadside,
or any other object that chanced to bar his
way! And this time Old Jerry&#8217;s face twitched and
went whiter even than before.</p>
<p>Nobody laughed, not even after the yellow-wheeled
buckboard with its strangely assorted pair
of passengers had sped from sight toward the county
seat and a legal adjustment of still another mortgage
on the Bolton acres. Not a word was spoken
until Old Jerry, too, had clambered silently into his
own creaking buggy and crawled slowly off up the
hill, with a squealing accompaniment of ungreased
axles.</p>
<p>And even then, in the argument which began with
a swirl of conjecture and ended, hours later, in a
torrent of bitter personalities farthest of all from
the first question under consideration, they avoided
a mention of that regrettable incident just as for some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
time after its occurrence they avoided each other&#8217;s
eyes, as if they felt somehow that theirs was, after
all, the real guilt.</p>
<p>Upon one point alone did they agree; they were
unanimous that if Young Denny Bolton&#8217;s bearing
that morning&ndash;&ndash;the angle at which he held his chin,
and the huge cut that adorned it, and his causeless
mirth&ndash;&ndash;was not entirely damning, it was at least suspicious
enough to require more than a little explanation.
But that verdict, too, was none other than the
very one which the Judge had already planned for
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Old Jerry drove his route that morning in
a numbed, trancelike fashion; or, rather, he
sat there upon the worn-out leather seat
with the reins looped over the dash, staring straight
ahead of him, and allowed the fat old mare to
take her own pace. It was she who made the customary
stops; he merely dug absent-mindedly beneath
the seat whenever she fell to cropping grass at the
roadside, and searched mechanically for the proper
packet of mail. And twice he was called back to
correct mistakes which he admitted were his own
with an humbleness that was alarming to the complainant.
In all the days of his service he had never
before failed to plead extenuating circumstances for
any slip that might occur&ndash;&ndash;and to plead with much
heat and staccato eloquence. But then, too, in all
those years no day had ever equalled the bitter awakening
of that morning.</p>
<p>As he reviewed it all, again and again, Old Jerry
began to understand that it was not the public rebuff
which had hurt so much; for there was that one of
the night previous, when the Judge had cut him off
in the middle of his eager corroboration of Jed The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Red&#8217;s history, which had not left a trace of a sting
twelve hours later. It was more than wounded vanity,
although hurt pride was still struggling for a
place in his emotions against a shamed, overwhelming
realization of his own trifling importance, which
could not hold its own against the first interloper,
even after years of entrenchment. Judge Maynard&#8217;s
first thrill had been staged without a hitch; he had
paved the way for the personal triumph which he
meant to achieve that night, but he had accomplished
it only at a cost&ndash;&ndash;the loyalty of him who had been,
after all, his stanchest supporter.</p>
<p>From that moment Old Jerry&#8217;s defection from the
ranks must be dated, for it was in those bitter hours
which followed the yellow-wheeled buckboard&#8217;s
early morning flight down the main street that the
old man woke to the fact that his admiration for the
Judge was made of anything but immortal stuff.
He weighed the Judge in the balance that morning,
and half forgot his own woe in marveling at the
discrepancies which he discovered.</p>
<p>Self-deceit may or may not be easy of accomplishment.
Maybe it is merely a matter of temperament
and circumstance, after all. But it is a certainty
that the first peep at one&#8217;s own soul is always the
most startling&ndash;&ndash;the most illuminating, always hardest
of all to bear. And once stripped of that one
garment of grandeur, which he had conjured out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
his own great hunger for attention, Old Jerry found
a ruthless, half-savage joy in tearing aside veil after
veil, until he found himself gazing straight back
into the eyes of his own spirit&ndash;&ndash;until he saw the
pitiful old fraud he really was, naked there before
him.</p>
<p>Just as well as though he had been a party to it
he understood the Judge&#8217;s crafty exhibition of Young
Denny&#8217;s maimed face that morning; he knew without
a trace of doubt just what the Judge, in his
ominous silence, had meant to insinuate, and what
the verdict would be that night around the Tavern
stove. What he could not understand quite was
why all of them were so easy to convince&ndash;&ndash;so ready
to believe&ndash;&ndash;when only the night before they had
sat and heard the Judge&#8217;s recital of Jed The Red&#8217;s
intimate history for the benefit of the newspaper
man from the metropolis which, to name it charitably,
had been anything but a literal translation of
facts.</p>
<p>Groping back for one single peg upon which to
hang the fabric of their oft-reiterated prophesy was
alarmingly profitless. There had been nothing, not
even one little slip, since Old Denny Bolton&#8217;s passing
on that bad night, years before. And from that
realization he fell to pondering with less leadenness
of spirit upon what the real facts could be which
lay behind Young Denny&#8217;s sudden transformation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
For that also was too real&ndash;&ndash;too evident&ndash;&ndash;for any
eyes to overlook.</p>
<p>It was not until long after the hour which witnessed
the return flight of the yellow-wheeled buckboard
through the village street, leaving behind an
even busier hum of conjecture than before, that he
awoke to a realization that his opportunity for a
solution of the riddle was at least better than that of
the wrangling group that had turned traitor before
the post-office steps.</p>
<p>Long before he reached the top of the grade
that ran up to the bleak house alone on the crest,
he was leaning out of his seat, trying to penetrate
the double gloom of rain and twilight; but not until
he had reined in his horse was he positive that there
was no shadowy figure standing there waiting for
his arrival.</p>
<p>He could not quite understand the sensation which
the boy&#8217;s absence waked in him at that instant. Days
afterward he knew it had been lonesomeness&ndash;&ndash;a
rather bewildering loneliness&ndash;&ndash;for no matter what
his reception chanced to be along the way, Young
Denny&#8217;s greeting had been infallibly regular.</p>
<p>And another emotion far less difficult to understand
began to stir within him as he sat motionless
for a time scanning the shapeless bulk of the place,
entirely dark save for a single light in the rear room.
For the first time he saw how utterly apart from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the rest of the town those unpainted old farm buildings
were&ndash;&ndash;how utterly isolated. The twinkling
lights of the village were mere pin-points in the
distance. Each thick shadow beneath the eaves of
the house was blacker than he had ever noticed before.
Even the soft swish of the rain as it seeped
from the sodden shingles, even the very familiar
complaint of loose nails lifted by the wind under the
clapboards, set his heart pumping faster. All in
an instant his sensation-hungry old brain seized upon
each detail that was as old as he himself and manufactured,
right there on the spot, a sinister something&ndash;&ndash;a
something of unaccountable dread, which
sent a delightful shiver up and down his thin, bony,
old back.</p>
<p>For a while he waited and debated with himself,
not at all certain now that he was as keen for a
solution of the riddle of that cut which had adorned
Young Denny&#8217;s chin as he had been. And yet, even
while he hesitated, feeding his imagination upon the
choicest of premonitory tit-bits, he knew he meant
to go ahead. He was magnifying the unfathomed
peril that existed in his erratic, hair-trigger old brain
alone merely for the sake of the complacent pride
which resulted therefrom&ndash;&ndash;pride in the contemplation
of his own intrepid dare-deviltry.</p>
<p>He could scarcely have put into words just what
reception he had imagined was awaiting him; but,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
whatever it might have been, Young Denny&#8217;s greeting
was full as startling. A worn, dusty, shapeless leather
bag stood agape upon the table before the window,
and Denny Bolton paused over the half-folded garment
in his hands to wheel sharply toward the newcomer
as the door creaked open.</p>
<p>For one uncomfortable moment the old adventurer
waited in vain for any light of welcome, or even
recognition, to flash up in the boy&#8217;s steady scrutiny.
Then the vaguest of smiles began to twitch at the
corners of Denny&#8217;s lips. He laid the coat back upon
the table and stepped forward a pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&ndash;&ndash;Here at last, are you?&#8221; he saluted.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you pretty late tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry swallowed hard at the cheery ease of
the words, but his fluttery heart began to pump even
faster than when he had sat outside in the buggy debating
the advisability of his further advance. That
warning premonition had not been a footless thing,
after all, for this self-certain, vaguely amused person
who stood steadily contemplating him was not the
Denny Bolton he had known twenty-four hours before&ndash;&ndash;not
from any angle or viewpoint.</p>
<p>Behind the simulated cheer of his greeting there
was something else which Old Jerry found disturbingly
new and hard to place. In his perplexity the
wordless accusation that morning had been correct at
that. And Young Denny was smiling widely at him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
now&ndash;&ndash;smiling openly. The old man shuffled his feet
and shifted his gaze from the open wound upon the
boy&#8217;s face as though he feared his suspicion might
be read in his eyes. Then he answered Denny&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I cal&#8217;late I be late&ndash;&ndash;maybe a little,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>Denny nodded briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than a little,&#8221; he corrected. &#8220;I expected
you to be along even earlier today! An hour or two,
at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even while he was speaking Young Denny turned
back to the packing of the big bag on the table. Old
Jerry stood there, still shifting from one foot to
the other, considering in growing wonder that silent
preparation, and waiting patiently for a further explanation
of what it meant. At last, when he could
no longer endure the suspense, he broke that silence
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Packin&#8217; up for a little trip, be you?&#8221; he ventured
mildly.</p>
<p>There was no progress made or satisfaction gained
from Young Denny&#8217;s short nod. Again the little man
bore it as long as he was able.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figurin&#8217; on bein&#8217; gone quite a spell?&#8221; he ventured
again.</p>
<p>And again the big-shouldered figure nodded a silent
affirmative. Old Jerry drew himself up with an air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
of injured dignity at that inhospitable slight; he even
took one step backward toward the door; but that
one step, in the face of his consuming curiosity, was
as far as he could force himself to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I kinda thought you might be leavin&#8217;. Why,
I&ndash;&ndash;kinda suspicioned it this morning when I seen
you ridin&#8217; townward with the Jedge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy stuffed the last article into the bulging
bag and turned. Old Jerry almost believed that the
lack of comprehension in Young Denny&#8217;s eyes was
real until he caught again that hint of amusement
behind it. But when Denny started toward him suddenly,
without so much as a word, the old man retreated
just as suddenly, almost apprehensively, before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you was expectin&#8217; me,&#8221; he faltered unsteadily,
&#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;but if there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t anything special
you wanted to see me about, I&ndash;&ndash;I reckon I better
be joggin&#8217; along. I just kinda dropped in, late&#8217;s it
was, to tell you there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no mail, and to say&ndash;&ndash;to
tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly. He didn&#8217;t like the looks of
Denny Bolton&#8217;s eyes. They were different than he
had ever seen them before. If their inscrutability
was not actually terrifying, Old Jerry&#8217;s active imagination
at that moment made it so. And never before
had he noted how huge the boy&#8217;s body was in comparison
with his own weazened frame. He groped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
stealthily behind him and found the door catch. The
cool touch of the metal helped him a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I may be a trifle late&ndash;&ndash;jest a trifle,&#8221; he hurried
on, &#8220;but I been hustlin&#8217; to git here&ndash;&ndash;that is, ever sense
about five o&#8217;clock, or thereabouts. There&#8217;s been something
I been wantin&#8217; to tell you. I&ndash;&ndash;I jest wanted to
say that I hoped it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t anything I might have said
or&ndash;&ndash;or kinda hinted at, maybe, nights down to the
Tavern, that&#8217;s druv you out. That&#8217;s a mighty mean,
gossipy crowd down there, anyway, always kinda
leadin&#8217; a man along till he gits to oversteppin&#8217; hisself
a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first declaration of his own shortcomings
that he had ever voiced, an humble confession that
was more than half apology born of that afternoon&#8217;s
travail of spirit; but somehow it rang hopelessly inadequate
in his own ears at that minute. And yet
Young Denny&#8217;s head came swiftly forward at the
words; his eyes narrowed and he frowned as though
he were trying to believe he had heard correctly.
Then he laughed&ndash;&ndash;laughed softly&ndash;&ndash;and Old Jerry
knew what that laugh meant. The boy didn&#8217;t believe
even when he had heard; and his slow-drawled, half-satirical
question more than confirmed that suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t at all curious, then, about this?&#8221; he inquired,
with a whimsical twist to the words.</p>
<p>He touched his chin with the tips of his fingers.
Old Jerry&#8217;s treacherous lips flew open in his eagerness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
and then closed barely in time upon the admission
that had almost betrayed him.</p>
<p>He was sorry now, too, that he had even lingered
to make his apology. That disturbing glint was flaring
brighter than ever in Young Denny&#8217;s eyes. Merely
because he was afraid to turn his back to pass out,
Old Jerry stood and watched with beadily attentive
eyes while the boy crossed and took a lantern from
its peg on the wall behind the stove and turned up
the wick and lighted it. That unexplained preparation
was as fascinating to watch as its purport was
veiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be just a little curious about it&ndash;&ndash;just
a little bit?&#8221; Denny insisted gravely. &#8220;I thought
you&#8217;d be&ndash;&ndash;and all the others, too. That&#8217;s why I was
waiting for you&ndash;&ndash;that and something in particular
that I did want to ask you, after I&#8217;d made you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the first part of his statement was still tinged
with mirth, the second could not possibly have been
any more direct or earnest. Without further explanation,
one hand grasping his visitor&#8217;s thin shoulder,
he urged him outside and across the yard in the
direction of the black bulk of the barn. The rain
was still coming down steadily, but neither of them
noticed it at that moment. Old Jerry would have
balked at the yawning barn door but for that same
hand which was directing him and urging him on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
His apprehension had now turned to actual fright
which bordered close on panic, and he heard the boy&#8217;s
voice as though it came from a great distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;two or three things I&#8217;d like to have you
understand and get straight,&#8221; Denny was repeating
slowly, &#8220;so that&ndash;&ndash;so that if I asked you, you could
see that&ndash;&ndash;someone else got them straight, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry was in no mental condition to realize
that that last statement was untinged by any lurking
sarcasm. He was able to think of but one
thing.</p>
<p>The hand upon his shoulder had loosened its grip.
Slowly the little man turned&ndash;&ndash;turned with infinite
caution, and what he considered was a very capable
attitude of self-defense. And for a moment he refused
to believe his own eyes&ndash;&ndash;refused to believe that,
in place of the threat of sudden death which he had
expected, Young Denny was merely standing there
before him, pointing with his free hand at a dark,
almost damp stain upon the dusty woodwork behind
the stalls. It flashed through his brain then that
Denny Bolton had not merely gone the way of the
other Boltons&ndash;&ndash;it was not the jug alone that had stood
in the kitchen corner, but something far worse than
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to humor him,&#8221; he told himself, although he
was shivering uncontrollably. &#8220;I got to keep a grip
on myself and kinda humor him.&#8221; And aloud, in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
voice that was little more than a whisper, he murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you guess&ndash;&ndash;if you had to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny made the suggestion with appalling calm.
Old Jerry clenched his teeth to still their chattering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I could&ndash;&ndash;maybe I could;&#8221; and his voice
was a little stronger. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d say it was blood, I
reckon, if anyone asked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word the boy set the lantern down and
walked across the barn to lay one hand upon the
flank of the nervous animal in the nearest stall.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; he stated slowly; and again he
touched the wound on his chin gingerly. &#8220;From this,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;I came in last night to feed&ndash;&ndash;and I&ndash;&ndash;I
forgot to speak to Tom here, and it was dark. He&ndash;&ndash;he
laced out and caught me&ndash;&ndash;and that&#8217;s where I
landed, there against the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The servant of the &#8220;Gov&#8217;mint&#8221; nodded his comprehension&ndash;&ndash;he
nodded it volubly, with deep bows
that would have done credit to a dancing master, lest
his comprehensions seem in the least bit veiled with
doubt. He even clicked his tongue sympathetically,
just as the plump newspaper man had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a tap&ndash;&ndash;quite a tap!&#8221; he said as soothingly
as his uncertain tongue would permit; but he took care
to keep a safe distance between himself and his guide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
when Denny stooped and lifted the lantern and led
the way outside.</p>
<p>Now that he was free from that detaining hand
upon his shoulder, he contemplated the advisability
of a sudden dash for the buggy and flight behind
the fat white mare. Nothing but the weakened condition
of his own knees and a lack of confidence in
her ability to carry him clear kept him from acting
instantly upon that impulse. And then the summoning
voice of the great blurred figure which had been
zigzagging across the grass before him checked him
at the very moment of decision.</p>
<p>Young Denny had stopped beside a sapling that
stood in a direct line with the kitchen window, and
was pointing down at a heap of broken crockery that
lay at its foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if anyone was to ask you,&#8221; he was deliberately
inquiring, &#8220;what do you suppose you would say
that had been?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry knew! He knew without one chance
for doubt; but never before had the truth seemed
more overwhelmingly dreadful or surcharged with
peril. A dozen diplomatic evasions flashed through
his mind, and were all condemned as inadequate for
that crisis. He knew that candor was his safest
course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d say it looked mighty like a&ndash;&ndash;a
broken jug,&#8221; he quavered, with elaborate interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
&#8220;Jest a common, ordinary jug that&#8217;s kinda got broke,
somehow. Yes, sir-e-e, all broke up, as you might
say!&#8221;</p>
<p>His shrill cackle of a voice caught in his throat,
and grew husky, and then broke entirely. Even
Young Denny, absorbed as he was in his methodical
exhibition of all the evidence, became suddenly aware
that the little figure beside him was swallowing hard&ndash;&ndash;swallowing
with great, noisy gulps, and he lifted
the lantern until the yellow light fell full upon the
twitching face below him, illuminating every feature.
And he stared hard at all that the light revealed, for
Old Jerry&#8217;s face was very white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest a little, no-account jug that&#8217;s got busted,&#8221;
the shrill, bodiless voice went chattering on, while its
owner recoiled from the light. &#8220;Busted all to pieces
from hittin&#8217; into a tree!&#8221; And then, reassuringly, on
a desperate impulse: &#8220;But don&#8217;t you go to worryin&#8217;
over it&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you worry one mite! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to fix
it for you. Old Jerry&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to fix it for you in the
morning, so&#8217;s it&#8217;ll be just as good as new! You run
right along in now. It&#8217;s kinda wet out here&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
I got to be gittin&#8217; along toward home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolute silence followed the promise. Young
Denny only lowered the lantern&ndash;&ndash;and then lifted it
and stared, and lowered it once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fix it!&#8221; he echoed, his voice heavy with wonder.
&#8220;Fix it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>Then he noted, too, the chattering teeth and
meager, trembling body, and he thought he understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come along in,&#8221; he ordered peremptorily.
&#8220;You come along inside. I&#8217;ll rake up the fire
and you can warm up a bit. I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t think, keeping
you out here in the rain. Why, you&#8217;ll feel better
after you&#8217;ve had a little rest. You ought not to be
out all day in weather like this, anyway. You&#8217;re
too&ndash;&ndash;too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was going to say too old, but a quick thought
saved him. Old Jerry did not want to accompany
him; he would have done almost anything else with
a light heart; but that big hand had fallen again upon
his shoulder, and there was no choice left him.</p>
<p>Young Denny clicked the door shut before them
and pulled a chair up before the stove with businesslike
haste. After he had stuffed the fire-box full of fresh
fuel and the flame was roaring up the pipe, he turned
once more and stood, hands resting on his hips, staring
down at the small figure slumped deep in its seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he apologized again, his
voice very sober. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I ought to have remembered
that maybe you&#8217;d be tired out and wet, too. But I
didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I was just thinking of how I could best
show you&ndash;&ndash;these things&ndash;&ndash;so&#8217;s you&#8217;d understand
them. You&#8217;re feeling better now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Furtively, from the corners of his eyes, Old Jerry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
had been watching every move while the boy built up
the fire. And now, while Denny stood over him
talking so gravely, his head came slowly around until
his eyes were full upon that face; until he was able
to see clearly, there in the better light of that room,
all the solicitude that had softened the hard lines
of the lean jaw. It was hard to believe, after all that
he had passed through, and yet he knew that it could
not be possible&ndash;&ndash;he knew that that voice could not
belong to any man who had been nursing a maniacal
vengeance behind a cunningly calm exterior.</p>
<p>There was no light of madness in those eyes which
were studying him so steadily&ndash;&ndash;studying him with unconcealed
anxiety. Old Jerry could not have told
how it had come about; but there in the light, with
four good solid walls about him, he realized that a
miracle had taken place. Little by little his slack
body began to stiffen; little by little he raised himself.
Once he sighed, a sigh of deeper thankfulness than
Young Denny could ever comprehend, for Young
Denny did not know the awfulness of the peril
through which he had just passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Godfrey&#8221; he thought, and the exclamation was
so poignantly real within him that it took audible
form without his knowledge. &#8220;Godfrey &#8217;Lisha, but
that was a close call! That&#8217;s about as narrer a squeak
as I&#8217;ll ever hev, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he wanted to laugh. An almost hysterical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
fit of laughter straggled for utterance. Only because
the situation was too precious to squander, only because
he would have sacrificed both arms before
confessing the terror which had been shaking him
by the throat, was he able to stifle it. Instead, he
removed his drenched and battered hat and passed
one fluttering hand across his forehead, with just the
shade of unsteadiness for which the affair called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a-feelin&#8217; better now,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;Godfrey,
yes, I&#8217;m a sight better already! Must &#8217;a&#8217; been
just a little touch of faintness, maybe. I&#8217;m kinda
subject to them spells when I&#8217;ve been overworked.
And I hev been a little mite druv up today&ndash;&ndash;druv to
the limit, if the truth&#8217;s told. Things ain&#8217;t been goin&#8217;
as smooth&#8217;s they might. Why&ndash;&ndash;why, they ain&#8217;t nobody&#8217;d
believe what&#8217;s been crowded into this day,
even if I was to tell &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>He filled his lungs again and shoved both feet
closer to the oven door.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that fire feels real nice,&#8221; he finished; &#8220;real
nice and comfortin&#8217;, somehow. And maybe I could
stop just a minute.&#8221; The old hungry light of curiosity
was kindling again, brighter than ever before,
in the beady little eyes. &#8220;As you was remarkin&#8217;,
back a stretch, you&#8217;d been a-waitin&#8217; for me to come
along. Was they&ndash;&ndash;was they something you wanted
to see me about?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_X' id='CHAPTER_X'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>The perplexed frown still furrowed Young
Denny&#8217;s forehead. He felt that the fire had
wrought a most remarkably swift cure of all
that he had feared, but the anxiety faded from his
eyes. White head perked forward, balanced a little
on one side, birdlike, Old Jerry was waiting for him
to pick up the thread which had been broken so long.
And now it was the big-shouldered boy who faltered
in his words, uncertain just how to begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know just how to ask you,&#8221; he started
heavily. &#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;I am going away. I&#8217;m figuring on
being gone quite a while, I think. First, just after
I had decided to go, some time last night, I made up
my mind to ask you to take care of the stock till I
came back. I thought maybe it wouldn&#8217;t be too hard
for you&ndash;&ndash;with you coming by at night, anyhow.
There&#8217;s just the one cow and the team, and the hens
to feed. And then I&ndash;&ndash;I got to thinkin&#8217; that maybe,
too, you&#8217;d be able to do something else for me, if
I sort of explained how things were. There&ndash;&ndash;there
wasn&#8217;t anyone else I could think of who&#8217;d be likely
to want to do me a favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and licked his lips. And Old Jerry, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
furtively touched his with the tip of his tongue. He
was waiting breathlessly, but he managed to nod his
head a little, encouragingly, as he leaned closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was what I was really waiting for,&#8221;
the slow voice went on ponderously. &#8220;I saw this
morning&ndash;&ndash;anybody could have seen&ndash;&ndash;what the Judge
meant them all to believe along the street when we
drove through. Somehow things have changed in the
last twelve hours. I sort of look at some things
differently than I did, and so it was funny, just funny
to watch him, and I&#8217;m not so blind that I don&#8217;t know
what his story will be tonight down at the Tavern.
Not that I care what they say, either. But there is
some one who couldn&#8217;t help believin&#8217; it&ndash;&ndash;couldn&#8217;t believe
anything else&ndash;&ndash;after what happened last night.&#8221;
He stopped, groping for words to finish. &#8220;And so
I&ndash;&ndash;I waited for you to come,&#8221; he went on lamely. &#8220;I
took you outside and showed you how it really happened,
so that&ndash;&ndash;so that you could tell <i>her</i>&ndash;&ndash;the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded over his shoulder&ndash;&ndash;nodded once out
across the valley in the direction of John Anderson&#8217;s
small drab cottage huddled in the shadow under the
hill. And now, once he had fairly begun, all the
diffidence, all the self-consciousness went from his
voice. It was only big and low and ponderous, as
always, as he went back and told the old man, who
sat drinking it in, every detail of that night before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
when he had stooped and risen and sent the stone jug
crashing through the window&ndash;&ndash;when he had turned,
with blood dripping from his chin, to find Dryad
Anderson there in the doorway, eyes wide with horror
and loathing. Not until he had reached that
point did Old Jerry move or hint at an interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why in time didn&#8217;t you tell her yourself?&#8221; he
asked then. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you explain that old Tom
hit you a clip out there in the dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny&#8217;s face burned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I tried to,&#8221; he explained simply. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I
started toward her, meaning to explain, but I tripped,
there on the threshold, and went down on my knees.
I must have been a little sick&ndash;&ndash;a little giddy. And
when I got up again she&ndash;&ndash;she was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry nodded his head judicially. He sucked
in his lips from sheer delight in the thrill of it all,
and nodded his head in profound solemnity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest like a woman&ndash;&ndash;jest like a woman, a-condemnin&#8217;
of a man without a bit of mercy! Jest like
&#8217;em! I ain&#8217;t never been enticed yet into givin&#8217; up
my freedom; but many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve said&ndash;&ndash;says
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s set face checked him; made him remember.
This was no mimic thing. It was real;
too real to need play-acting. And with that thought
came recollection. All in a flash it dawned on him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
that this was no man-created situation; it must have
something greater than that behind it.</p>
<p>That morning had seen his passing from the circle
to which he had belonged as long as the circle had
existed. All through that dreary day he had known
that he could never go back to it. Just why he could
not say, but he felt that that decision was irrevocable.
And for that whole day he had been alone&ndash;&ndash;more
utterly, absolutely alone than he had ever been in his
whole life&ndash;&ndash;yet here was a place awaiting him, needing
him. For some reason it was not quite so hard
to look straight back into the eyes of that soul which
he had discovered that day; it wasn&#8217;t so hard, even
though he knew it now for the pitiful old fraud it
really was.</p>
<p>His thin, leathery face was working spasmodically.
And it was alight&ndash;&ndash;aglow with a light that came
entirely from within.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you maybe explain,&#8221; he quavered hungrily;
&#8220;could you kinda tell me&ndash;&ndash;just why it is&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
a-askin&#8217; me? It&ndash;&ndash;it ain&#8217;t jest because you hev to,
entirely; now, is it? It ain&#8217;t because there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
else left you to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny Bolton sensed immediately more than half
of what was behind the question. He shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered steadily. &#8220;No, because I&#8217;m
going to try to tell her again, myself, tonight. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
only partly because maybe I&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t be able to see
her before I go&ndash;&ndash;and part because she&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;d believe
you, somehow, I think, when she wouldn&#8217;t believe
any of the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white-haired old man sighed. His stiffened
body slackened as he shifted his feet against the
stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, I kinda hoped it was something like
that,&#8221; he murmured; and he was talking more to
himself than to Denny. &#8220;I kinda hoped it was&ndash;&ndash;but
I never had no reason to believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice lifted until it was its shriller, more natural
falsetto.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; believed myself today, at twelve
o&#8217;clock noon,&#8221; he stated flatly. &#8220;No, sir-e-e! After
takin&#8217; stock of myself, as you might say, the way I
done this morning, I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; believed myself on
oath!&#8221;</p>
<p>His feet dropped noisily to the floor, and he sat
bolt upright again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to believe me! Godfrey, yes,
she&#8217;ll believe me when I git through tellin&#8217; her!&#8221;</p>
<p>His pale eyes clung to the boy&#8217;s face, tinged with
astonishment before so much vehemence.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ain&#8217;t it kinda struck you&ndash;&ndash;ain&#8217;t it sorta come
to you that she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t quite fair, either, any more
than the rest of us, a-thinkin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;a-thinkin&#8217; what she
did, without any real proof?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>Young Denny did not have time to reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon it ain&#8217;t,&#8221; Old Jerry rushed on.
&#8220;And I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s I&#8217;ve got much right criticizing
either. Not very much! I&#8217;ve been a tidy hand at
jedgin&#8217; other folks&#8217; matters until jest lately. Some
way I ain&#8217;t quite so handy at it as I was. And I kinda
expect she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be sorry she even thought it,
soon enough, without my tryin&#8217; to make her any more
so. She&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be mighty uncomfortable sorry,
if she&#8217;s anything like me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and shuffled across to the door, and
stopped there. Denny could not understand the new
thrill there was in his cracked voice, nor the light
in those pale eyes. But he knew that the old man
before him had been making something close akin
to an eleventh-hour confession; making it out of a
profound thankfulness for the opportunity. With
the same gesture with which he bade the old man
wait, his big hand went inside his shirt, and came
out again. And he reached out and pressed something
into Old Jerry&#8217;s knotty fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I was sure you&#8217;d do it,&#8221; he told him. &#8220;I
knew you would. And I want you to take this, too,
and keep it. I don&#8217;t want to go away like this, but
I have to. If I didn&#8217;t start right now I&ndash;&ndash;I might
not go at all. I hate to leave her alone&ndash;&ndash;in this town.
That&#8217;s half of what the Judge let me have today on
this place. It&#8217;s not much, but it&#8217;s something if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
should need anything while I&#8217;m gone. I thought you
might&ndash;&ndash;see that she was all right&ndash;&ndash;till I got back?&#8221;</p>
<p>The servant of the &#8220;Gov&#8217;mint&#8221; stood and stared
down at the limp little roll of bills in his hand; he
stared until something caught in his throat and made
him gulp again noisily. But his face was shamelessly
defiant of the mist that smarted under his eyelids
when he looked up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of her?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Me take
care of her for you? Why&ndash;&ndash;why, Godfrey&ndash;&ndash;why,
man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed one hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a old gossipy fool,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Nothin&#8217;
but a old gossipy fool; but I reckon you don&#8217;t hev to
<i>count</i> them bills over before you leave &#8217;em with me.
Not unless you want to. I&#8217;ve been just an ordinary,
common waggle-tongue. That&#8217;s what I really come
for in such a hurry tonight, once I&#8217;d thought of it.
Jest to see if I couldn&#8217;t nose around into business
that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no concern of mine. But I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; over
that&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; over that fast! Learning a little
dignity of bearin&#8217;, too, as you might say. And I
don&#8217;t deny I ain&#8217;t a little curious yet&ndash;&ndash;more&#8217;n a little
curious. But I want to tell you this: There&#8217;s some
folks that lies mostly for profit, and some that lies
largely for their own amusement, and they both do
jest about as much damage in the long run, and I ain&#8217;t
no better, jest because I never made nothin&#8217; outen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
mine. But if you could kinda drop me a line, maybe
once in a while, and tell me how you&#8217;re gittin&#8217; on, I&#8217;d
be mighty glad to hear. An&#8217; it wouldn&#8217;t do no harm,
either.&#8221; He nodded his head, in turn, in the direction
of the drab cottage across the valley. &#8220;Because&ndash;&ndash;because
she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be waitin&#8217; to hear&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to be sorry, and kinda wonderin&#8217;. I know&ndash;&ndash;well,
jest because I know!&#8221;</p>
<p>Still he lingered, with his fingers on the door catch.
He shoved out his free hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I suppose we&#8217;d ought to shake hands, hedn&#8217;t
we,&#8221; he faltered; &#8220;bein&#8217; as it&#8217;s kinda considered the
reg&#8217;lar and customary thing to do on such occasions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny was smiling as his hand closed over those
clawlike fingers; he was smiling in a way that Old
Jerry had never seen before. Because the noise in
his throat was growing alarmingly louder every moment,
the latter went on talking almost wildly, to
cover that weakness which he could not control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you git on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I reckon you
will. It&#8217;s funny&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s more&#8217;n that&ndash;&ndash;and I don&#8217;t know
where I got the idea. But it&#8217;s kinda come to me,
somehow, that maybe it was that account in the paper&ndash;&ndash;that
story of Jeddy Conway&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s set you to
leavin&#8217;. It ain&#8217;t none of my business, and I ain&#8217;t askin&#8217;
no questions, but I do want to say that there never
was a time when you couldn&#8217;t lick the everlastin&#8217; tar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
outen him. And you&#8217;ve growed some since then.
Jest a trifle&ndash;&ndash;jest a trifle!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s smile widened and widened. Then he
laughed aloud softly and nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send you the papers,&#8221; he promised. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send
you all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry stood with his outstretched hand poised
in midair while he realized that his chance shot had
gone home. And suddenly, unaccountably, he began
to chuckle; he began to cackle noisily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might &#8217;a&#8217; knowed it,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I ought
to hev knowed it all along. Now, you don&#8217;t hev to
worry&ndash;&ndash;they ain&#8217;t one mite of a thing I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217;
to see to while you&#8217;re away. You don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217;
on your mind, because you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to hev a
considerable somethin&#8217; on your hands. And I got
to git along now. Godfrey, but it&#8217;s late for me to
be up here, ain&#8217;t it? I got to hustle, if I ever did;
and there ain&#8217;t too much time to spare. For tonight&ndash;&ndash;tonight,
before I git through, I aim to put a spoke
in the Jedge&#8217;s wheel, down to the Tavern, that&#8217;ll
make him think the axles of that yello&#8217;-wheeled gig
of his&#8217;n needs greasin&#8217;. Jest a trifle&ndash;&ndash;jest a trifle!&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the door and slammed it shut behind
him even before the boy could reply. Still smiling
whimsically, Young Denny stood and listened to the
grating of the wheels as the buggy was turned about
outside&ndash;&ndash;heard the old rig groan once, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
complain shrilly as it started on its way. But no
one witnessed Old Jerry&#8217;s wild descent to the village
that night; no one knew the mad speed he made, save
the old mare between the shafts; and she was kept
too busy with the lash that whistled over her fat
flanks to have given the matter any consistent
thought.</p>
<p>Old Jerry drove that scant mile or two this night
under the spur of his one greatest inspiration; and
while he drove he talked aloud to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was a-goin&#8217; to fix it for him,&#8221; he muttered
once, &#8220;I was a-goin&#8217; to fix that old busted jug in
the morning. Godfrey, I must &#8217;a&#8217; been flustered!&#8221;
He shrilled in uncontrollable glee at the recollection.
And then again, later and far more gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-gittin&#8217; more religious every livin&#8217; day. I&#8217;m
gittin&#8217; more religious jest from standin&#8217; around and
kinda watchin&#8217; how things is made to work out right,
jest when you&#8217;ve about decided that the Lord ain&#8217;t
payin&#8217; as much attention to details as he might.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew that there had to be a light in the windows
of the Tavern office; he knew that he had to be
in time. That was the finger of a Something behind
the whole day&#8217;s developments which was directing
it all so masterfully. And because he was so certain
of it all&ndash;&ndash;because he was positive that he was the
agent who had been selected to mete out justice at last&ndash;&ndash;he
found himself possessed of a greater courage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
than he had ever known before as he clambered
down from his seat and mounted the worn steps.</p>
<p>A rush of chill air swept the group about the
sprawling stove as he opened the door and made each
member lift his head, each after a fashion that was
startlingly indicative of the man himself. For Judge
Maynard wheeled sharply as the cold blast struck him&ndash;&ndash;wheeled
with head flung back challengingly, and
a harsh rebuke in every feature&ndash;&ndash;while old Dave
Shepard turned and merely shivered. He just shivered
and flinched a little from the draft, appealingly. The
rest registered an ascending scale of emotions betwixt
and between.</p>
<p>Just as he knew he would find them they sat.
Judge Maynard had the floor; and it was an easy
thing to read that he had all but reached the crisis
of his recital. Any man could have read that merely
from the protest in the faces of the rest. And yet
Old Jerry simply stood there and swept the group
with serene and dangerous geniality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evenin&#8217;, folks,&#8221; he saluted them mildly.</p>
<p>His mildness was like a match to the fuse. Judge
Maynard pounded his fat knee with a fatter fist, and
exploded thunderously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut that door!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Shut that door!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry complied with amazing alacrity. The
very panels shivered with the force of the swing that
slammed it close. The Judge should have known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
right there&ndash;&ndash;he should have read the writing on the
wall&ndash;&ndash;and yet he failed to do that thing. Instead,
he turned back once more to his audience&ndash;&ndash;back to
his interrupted tale, and left Old Jerry standing there
before the door, ignored.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was sayin&#8217;.&#8221; He cleared his throat. &#8220;As
I was sayin&#8217; when this unnecessary interruption occurred,
I realized right from the moment when I
opened the door and saw him standing there in front
of me, grinning, and his chin cut wide open, that
there was something wrong. I am a discerning man&ndash;&ndash;and
I knew! And it didn&#8217;t take me long to convince
him&ndash;&ndash;not very long!&ndash;&ndash;that there were other
communities which would find him more welcome than
this one. Maybe I was harsh&ndash;&ndash;maybe I was&ndash;&ndash;but
harsh cases require harsh remedies. And because
he didn&#8217;t have the money, I offered to let him have
enough to carry him out of town, and something to
keep him about as long as he&#8217;ll last now, I&#8217;m thinking,
although that place of his isn&#8217;t worth as much as
the paper to write the mortgage on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it had come at last&ndash;&ndash;but, at that, I didn&#8217;t
get anything that I wanted to call real proof until
after we&#8217;d drawn up the papers and signed &#8217;em, and
were about ready to start back. Then, when we were
coming down the steps of the clerk&#8217;s office, I got all
the proof I wanted, and a little more than that. He&ndash;&ndash;he
stumbled just about then, and would have gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
down on his face if I hadn&#8217;t held him up. And he
was laughing out loud to himself, chuckling, with
one fist full of money fit to draw a crowd. And he
pulled away from me just when I was trying to force
him into the buggy&ndash;&ndash;pulled away and sort of leered
up at me, waving that handful of bills right under my
nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, come now, Judge,&#8217; he sort of hiccoughed,
&#8216;this ain&#8217;t the way for two old friends to part. This
ain&#8217;t the way for me to treat an old friend who&#8217;s
given me this. I want to buy you something&ndash;&ndash;I want
to buy you at least one drink&ndash;&ndash;before I go. Come
on, now, Judge. What&#8217;ll you have?&#8217; says he.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had all forgotten Old Jerry&#8217;s interruption;
they had forgotten everything else but the Judge&#8217;s
recital, that was climbing to its climax. That room
was very quiet when the speaker paused and waited
for his words to sink in&ndash;&ndash;very quiet until a half-smothered
giggle broke the stillness.</p>
<p>There was an unholy glee in that mirth&ndash;&ndash;a mocking,
lilting note of actual joy which rang almost profane
at such a moment. Man for man it brought
that circle erect in the chairs; man for man they sat
and stared at the grotesque figure which was rocking
now in a paroxysm of laughter too real for simulation.
In a breathless hush they turned from the
offender back to the judge, waiting, appalled, for the
storm to break.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>Judge Maynard&#8217;s round moon-face went purple.
Twice he tried to speak before he sat silent, annihilation
in his eyes, until Jerry&#8217;s outbreak had subsided.
Then he lifted one forefinger and pointed,
with all the majesty such a gesture could ever convey,
to the empty chair&ndash;&ndash;the chair which Old Jerry should
have been occupying in becoming silence at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you gone crazy?&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;Have
you&ndash;&ndash;or are you just naturally witless? Or was there
something you wanted to say? If there isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;if
you&#8217;ve no questions to ask&ndash;&ndash;you get over to that
chair and sit down where you belong!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then that the rest of the circle realized
that something had gone wrong&ndash;&ndash;most mightily
wrong! According to all precedent, the little, white-haired
man should have shrunk back and cowered
beneath that verbal lash, and obeyed without a glance.
They all realized that there was imminent a climax
unforeseen by all&ndash;&ndash;all but the Judge; and he was too
blind with rage to see.</p>
<p>Very meekly Old Jerry bore his thundered rebuke&ndash;&ndash;too
meekly. But after the judge had finished he
failed to move; he merely stood there, facing the
town&#8217;s great man. And in his attitude there was
something of infantile, derisive, sparrowlike impudence
as he peered back into the Judge&#8217;s face&ndash;&ndash;something
that was very like the attitude of an outraged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
ruffled old reprobate of a parrot rearing himself erect.</p>
<p>Old Jerry made no haste. It was a thing which
required a nice deliberation. And so he waited&ndash;&ndash;waited
and prolonged the moment to its last, sweetest
second. Once more he chuckled, to himself this
time&ndash;&ndash;just once, before he began to speak. That
old Tavern office had never been so deathly still
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;A question?&#8221; he echoed at last, thoughtfully. &#8220;A
question? Well, Jedge, there was one thing I was
a-goin&#8217; to ask you. Jest one triflin&#8217; thing I was kinda
curious to know. Why, I was a-goin&#8217; to ask you,
back a spell&ndash;&ndash;What did you hev? It kinda interested
me, wonderin&#8217; about it. But now&ndash;&ndash;now that
I&#8217;ve heard your story in full, I reckon I&#8217;ll hev to
change that question a mite. I reckon they ain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; left but to ask you&ndash;&ndash;How many did you hev?
How many, Jedge? For, Jedge, you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; most
mighty wild tonight!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that silence endured&ndash;&ndash;endured even after the
huge man had half-risen, purple features gone white,
and then dropped heavily back into his chair before
that rigid figure in its sodden garments which had
turned from him toward the rest of the circle of
regulars.</p>
<p>Old Jerry made his formal exit that night&ndash;&ndash;he
knew that he was resigning his chair&ndash;&ndash;but the thing
was very cheap at the price.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I reckon, too,&#8221; he went on deliberately, and
there was a wicked fleer of sarcasm tinging the words,
&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll hev to kinda apologize to you gentlemen

<p>Nobody moved. Nobody was capable of stirring
even. Old Jerry bowed to them from the doorway&ndash;&ndash;he
bowed till the water trickled in a stream from the
brim of his battered hat.</p>
<p>And this time, as he passed out, he closed the
door very gently behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>It would have been hard for her to have explained
just why it was so, but Dryad Anderson had been
sitting there in the unlighted front room of the
little once-white cottage before Judge Maynard&#8217;s boxlike
place on the hill, watching hour after hour for
that light to blink out at her from the dark window of
Denny Bolton&#8217;s house on the opposite slope. Ever
since it had grown dark enough for that signal to be
seen, which had called across to her so many nights,
she had been waiting before the table in front of the
window&ndash;&ndash;waiting even while she told herself that it
could not appear. It was not Saturday night; there
was no real reason why she should be watching, unless&ndash;&ndash;unless
it was hope that held her there.</p>
<p>Only in the last few hours since twilight had she
admitted to herself the possibility that such a hope
lurked behind her vigil. Before then, when the
thought had first come to her that Denny might cry
out to her through the night, with that half-shuttered
light, she had stifled it with a savageness that left
her shaking, panting and dizzy from its bewildering
intensity.</p>
<p>Time after time she told herself that it would go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
unheeded by her, no matter how long or how insistently
it beckoned, if by the hundredth chance it should
flare up beyond the shadows, but as minutes dragged
interminably by into equally interminable hours, the
strained fierceness of that whispered promise grew
less and less knifelike in its hardness&ndash;&ndash;less and less
assured.</p>
<p>Somehow, ever since the first light of that gray
day had discovered her sitting there in almost the
same position in which she now sat, eyes straining
out across the valley, pointed chin cupped in her
palms, that fearful, almost insane passion which had
held each nerve and fiber of her taut as tight-stretched
wire through the entire sleepless night, had begun
to give way to something even less easy to endure.</p>
<p>All the terror which had checked her that evening
when she swung the door open and stood poised
on the threshold, a low laugh of sheerest delight in
the costume she had worn across for him to see ready
to burst from parted lips&ndash;&ndash;all the horror that had
held her incapable of motion until Denny had swung
around and found her there, and lifted his arms and
attempted to speak, had given way, in the first hours
that followed, to a flaming scorn, a searing contempt
for him and for his weakness that had lost him his
fight.</p>
<p>All through that night which followed her panic
flight from the huge, heavy-footed figure that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
groped out for her, called to her, and dropped asprawl
her own small cloak in the doorway, Denny Bolton&#8217;s
blood-soiled face and drunkenly reckless laugh had
been with her, feeding that rage which scorched her
eyes beneath their lids&ndash;&ndash;that burned her throat and
choked her.</p>
<p>Little drops of blood oozed out upon her lips&ndash;&ndash;strangely
brilliant crimson drops against that colorless
background&ndash;&ndash;where her teeth sank deep in the
agony of disillusionment that made each pulse-beat
a sledge-hammer blow within her brain. Her small
palms were etched blue under the clenched fingers
where the nails bit the flesh. And yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet, for
all the agony of it which made her lift her blanched
face from time to time throughout the night&ndash;&ndash;a face
so terribly strained that it was almost distorted&ndash;&ndash;and
set her gasping chokingly that she hated him, hated
him for a man who couldn&#8217;t fight and keep on fighting,
even when the odds were great&ndash;&ndash;when the light of
that new, dreary day had come streaking in across
her half-bowed head, something else began to take
the place of all that bitterness and scorn.</p>
<p>And throughout the day she had still been struggling
against it, struggling with all the tense fierceness
of which her spirit was capable&ndash;&ndash;her spirit that
was far too big for the slim body that housed it.
Yet that thought could not be shaken off. She
couldn&#8217;t forget it, couldn&#8217;t wipe out the recollection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of that great, gaping wound that had dripped blood
from his chin. She tried to close her eyes and shut
it out as she went from task to task that day, and
it would not fade.</p>
<p>Somehow it wasn&#8217;t that man at all whom she remembered
as the afternoon dragged by to its close; it
wasn&#8217;t the big-shouldered body nervelessly asprawl
upon the floor that filled her memory. Instead a
picture of an awkward, half-grown boy flashed up
before her&ndash;&ndash;a big, ungainly, terribly embarrassed boy
who turned from watching the mad flight of a rabbit
through the brush to smile at her reassuringly, even
though his face was torn raw from her own nails.</p>
<p>That was the point at which the tide of her chaotic
thoughts began to waver and turn. Long before
she realized what she was doing she had fallen to
wondering, with a solicitude that made moist and
misty once more her tip-tilted eyes and softened the
thin line of her lips, whether or not that bruise had
been washed out, cleansed and cleanly bandaged.</p>
<p>When she did realize what that thought meant, it
had been too long with her to be routed. She was
too tired to combat it, anyway, too tired with the
reaction of that long, throbbing night to do more
than wonder at herself. Twilight came and the gray
mist that had been over the hills for hours dissolved
into rain. With the first hint of darkness that the
storm brought with it she began to watch&ndash;&ndash;to peer out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
of the window whenever her busy footsteps carried
her past it, at the bleak place across the hollow.
Before it was fairly night she began to understand
that she was not merely watching for the light, but
hoping, praying wordlessly that it might shine. And
when her work was finished she had taken her place
there, her slim body in its scant black skirt and little
white blouse hunched boyishly forward as always
across the table.</p>
<p>Even that girl who, after the hours which had
been almost cataclysmic for her, could scarcely have
been expected to be able to comprehend it clearly yet&ndash;&ndash;even
she read the meaning of the slackened cords
of her body, of her loosened lips and wet eyes. As
long as she could she had fed the flame within her
soul&ndash;&ndash;fed it with every bitter thought and harsh
judgment which her brain could evolve&ndash;&ndash;and yet that
flame had slackened and smouldered and finally died
out entirely. Self-shame, self-scorn even, could not
rekindle it.</p>
<p>Her lips were no longer white and straight and
feverish with contempt; they were damp and full
again, and curved and half-open with compassion.
The ache was still there in her breast&ndash;&ndash;a great gnawing
pain which it seemed at that moment time could
never remove, but it was no longer the wild hatred
which made her pant with a desire to make him
suffer, too, just as she had suffered that night through.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
The pain was just as great, but it was pity now&ndash;&ndash;only
pity and an unaccountable yearning to draw that
bruised face down against her and croon over it.</p>
<p>In spite of the numbness, in spite of the lassitude
which that burnt-out passion had left behind in brain
and body, she knew what it meant. She understood.
She had hated his weakness; she still hated his lack
of manhood which had made him fail her. That
hatred would be a long time dying now&ndash;&ndash;if it ever
did perish. But she couldn&#8217;t hate <i>him</i>! She looked
that fact in the face, dumb at first at the awakening.
She couldn&#8217;t hate him&ndash;&ndash;not the man he was! There
was a distinction&ndash;&ndash;a difference very clear to her
woman-brain. She could despise his cowardice; she
could despise herself for caring still&ndash;&ndash;but the caring
still went on. Half-vaguely she realized it, but she
knew the change had come. The girlishness was
gone from it forever. She had to care now as a
woman always cares&ndash;&ndash;not for the thing he was, but
in spite of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to hate him,&#8221; she told herself once, aloud.
&#8220;I know I ought to hate him, and yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet I
don&#8217;t believe I can. Why, I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t even hate myself,
as I did a little while back, because I still care!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a habit that had grown out of her long
loneliness&ndash;&ndash;those half-whispered conversations with
herself. And now only one conviction remained.
Again and again she told herself that she could not go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to meet him that night&ndash;&ndash;could not go, even if he
should call to her. And that, too, she put into whispered
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if he lights the window, I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t!
Oh, not tonight! He won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;he won&#8217;t think of it.
But I couldn&#8217;t let him touch me&ndash;&ndash;until&ndash;&ndash;until I&#8217;ve
had a little time to forget!&#8221;</p>
<p>But she was watching still&ndash;&ndash;watching with small,
gold-crowned head nodding heavily, eyes half-veiled
with sinking lids&ndash;&ndash;when that half-shaded window in
the dark house glowed suddenly yellow with the light
behind it. She was still hoping, praying dumbly
that it might be, when Young Denny lifted the black-chimneyed
lamp from its bracket on the kitchen wall
that night, after he had stood and listened with a
smile on his lips to Old Jerry&#8217;s hurried departure, and
carried it into the front room which he scarcely ever
entered except upon that errand.</p>
<p>At first she did not believe. She thought it was
only a trick of her brain, so tired now that it was
as little capable of connected thought as her worn-out
body was of motion. Hardly breathing she stared
until she saw the great blot of his body silhouetted
against the pane for a moment as he crowded between
the lamp, staring across at her, she knew.</p>
<p>She rose then, rose slowly and very cautiously as
though she feared her slightest move might make it
vanish. Young Denny&#8217;s bobbing lantern, swinging in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
one hand as he crossed before the house and plunged
into the thicket that lay between them, was all that
convinced her&ndash;&ndash;made her believe that she had seen
aright.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; she breathed. And then,
lifting her head, vehemently, as if he could hear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to&ndash;&ndash;oh, you know I want to! But I can&#8217;t
come to you tonight&ndash;&ndash;not until I&#8217;ve had a little longer&ndash;&ndash;to
think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost before she had finished speaking another
voice answered, a soft, dreamy voice that came so
abruptly in the quiet house that it made her wheel
like a startled wild thing. She had forgotten him
for the time&ndash;&ndash;that little, stooped figure at its bench
in the back room workshop. For hours she had not
given him a thought, and he had made not so much
as a motion to make her remember his presence. She
could not even remember when his sing-song, unending
monologue had ceased, but she realized then that
he had been more silent that night than ever before.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening when she had lighted his
lamp for him and set out his lump of moist clay, and
helped him to his place on the high stool, she had
thought to notice some difference in him.</p>
<p>Usually John Anderson was possessed of one or
two unvarying moods. Either he plunged contentedly
into his task of reproducing the multitude of small
white figures around the walls, or else he merely sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
and stared up at her hopelessly, vacantly, until she put
the clay herself into his hands. Tonight it had been
different, for when she had placed the damp mass
between his limp fingers he had laid it aside again,
raised astonishingly clear eyes to hers and shaken
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a little&ndash;&ndash;after a little while,&#8221; he had said.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I want to think a little first.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had amazed her for a moment. At any other
time it would have frightened her, but tonight as
she stroked his bowed head, she told herself that it
was nothing more than a new vagary of his anchorless
mind.</p>
<p>But that same strangely clear, almost sane glow
which had puzzled her then was still there when she
turned. It was even brighter than before, and the
slow words which had startled her, for all their
dreamy softness, seemed very sane as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to go,&#8221; John Anderson answered her
faltering, half-audible whisper. &#8220;You have to go&ndash;&ndash;but
you&#8217;ll be back soon. Oh, so soon! And I&#8217;ll be
safe till you come!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dryad flashed forward a step, both hands half-raised
to her throat as he spoke, almost believing
that the miracle for which she had ceased even to
hope had come that night. And then she understood&ndash;&ndash;she
knew that the bent figure which had
already turned back to its bench had only repeated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
her words, parrotlike; she knew that he had only
pieced together a recollection of the absence which
her vigil before the window had meant on a former
occasion and repeated her own words of that other
night.</p>
<p>And yet her brain clamored that there was more
behind it all than mere witless repetition. John
Anderson was smiling at her, too, smiling like a
benevolent wraith. She saw that his pile of clay
was still untouched, but there was no hint of petulant
perplexity in his face, nothing of the terrified
impotence which the inactivity of his fingers had
always heralded before. He was just smiling&ndash;&ndash;vaguely
to be sure and a little uncertainly&ndash;&ndash;but
smiling in utter contentment and satisfaction, for all
that.</p>
<p>Very slowly&ndash;&ndash;wonderingly, she crossed to him and
put both arms about his white head and drew it
against her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you knew,&#8221; she said to him, unsteadily.
&#8220;I think you are able to understand better than I
can myself. And I know, too, now. I do have to
go&ndash;&ndash;I must go to him. But he need not even know,
until I tell him some day&ndash;&ndash;that I was with him tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man pulled away from her clasp, gently
but very insistently. And he nodded&ndash;&ndash;nodded as
though he had understood. She paused and looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
back at him from the doorway, just as she had always
hesitated. He was following her with his eyes.
Again he shook his head, just as positively as he
might have, had he been the man he might have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; he reiterated, serenely, &#8220;some day!
And she&#8217;ll know then&ndash;&ndash;some day I&#8217;ll tell her&ndash;&ndash;that
I was with her tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had forgotten the rain. It was coming down
heavily, and it was dark, too&ndash;&ndash;very, very dark. She
stopped a while, as long as she dared, and waited
with the rain beating cold upon her uncovered head
and bare throat until her eyes saw the path a little
more clearly. It took her a long time to feel her
way forward that night. And even when she came
within sight of Denny&#8217;s lantern, even when she was
near enough to see him through the thicket ahead
of her, in the little patch of light, she had not decided
what she meant to do.</p>
<p>But with that first glimpse of him squatting there
in the small cleared space it came to her what her
course should be. She realized that if it was an
impossibility for her to go to him, she could at least
let him know she had been there&ndash;&ndash;let him know that
he had not been entirely alone while he waited. She
even smiled to herself&ndash;&ndash;smiled with wistful, half-sad,
elfen tenderness as she, too, huddled down without
a sound, there in the wet bushes opposite him, and
decided how she would tell him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>Denny Bolton never quite knew how long he
waited in the rain before he was certain that
there was no use waiting longer. More than half
the night had dragged by when he reached finally
into the pockets of his coat and searched for a scrap
of paper. Watching from her place in the thicket
near him, she recognized the small white card which
he discovered&ndash;&ndash;she even reached out one hand instinctively
for her invitation from the Judge, which
she had told him had never arrived and for which
she had hunted in vain throughout the following
days.</p>
<p>With an unaccountable gladness because he knew
straining at her throat, she watched him draw the
lantern nearer and read again the words it bore before
he turned it over and wrote, laboriously, with
the thick pencil that he used to check logs back in
the hills, some message across its back.</p>
<p>It was a message to her, she knew; and she knew,
too, that he was going now. Deliberately she reached
out then and found a rotten branch beside her. Young
Denny&#8217;s head shot up as it cracked between her
hands&ndash;&ndash;shot swiftly erect while he stared hard at
that wall of darkness which hid her. And swiftly
as she fled, like some noiseless night creature of the
woods, his sudden, plunging rush almost discovered
her.</p>
<p>Back in the safety of the blackness she stood and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
saw him bend over the place where she had been
crouching; she saw him put his hand upon the patch
of dead ferns which her body had crushed flat, and
knew that he found it still warm. She even held up
her face, as though she were giving him her lips&ndash;&ndash;she
reached out her arms to him&ndash;&ndash;when she saw
him rise from an examination of her foot-prints in
the mold, smiling his slow, infinitely grave smile as
he nodded his head over what he had seen.</p>
<p>Back over the path she had come she followed
the dancing point of his lantern, sometimes almost
upon him, sometimes lagging far behind when he
stopped and strained his ears for her. All recollection
of the night before was gone from her mind,
wiped out as utterly as though it had never existed.
Nothing but a great gladness possessed her, a joy
that amounted almost to mischievous glee whenever
he stood still a moment and listened.</p>
<p>Not until she had waited many minutes after he
stooped and slipped the card beneath the door did
she come out from the cover of the woods. But she
raced forward madly then, and flung the door open,
and stooped for it where it lay white against the
floor.</p>
<p>All the mischievous glee went from her face in
that next moment. Bit by bit it faded before the
advance of that same strained whiteness that had
marred it, hours before. All the wistfulness that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
made her face so childlike, all the hunger that made
the hurt in her breast came back while she read,
over and over, the words which Denny had written
for her across the back of her card, until she could
repeat them without looking at it. And even then
she only half-understood what they meant. Once
she opened the door and peered out into the blackness,
searching for the lantern that had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;why he&#8217;s gone! He came to tell me that
he was going away,&#8221; she murmured, dully. And
then, still more dully:</p>
<p>&#8220;And I didn&#8217;t tell him I was sorry. I&#8217;ve let him
go without even telling him how sorry I was&ndash;&ndash;for
the hurt upon his chin!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the silence that made her turn;
perhaps she simply turned with no thought or reason
at all, but she faced slowly about at that moment,
just in time to see John Anderson nod and
smile happily at something he alone could see&ndash;&ndash;just
in time to hear him sigh softly once, before his arms
went slack upon his work-bench and his head drooped
forward above them.</p>
<p>The bit of a card fluttered to the floor as both her
tight-clenched fists lifted toward her throat. The
softest of pitying little moans came quavering from
her lips. She needed no explanation of what that
suddenly limp body meant! And she understood
better now, too, that untouched lump of clay upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the boards beside his bowed head. John Anderson&#8217;s
long task was finished. He had known it was finished,
and had been merely resting tonight&ndash;&ndash;resting
content before he started upon that long journey,
before he followed that face, tumbled of hair and
uplifted of lip, which seemed always to be calling
to him.</p>
<p>The slim-bodied girl whose face was so like what
that other woman&#8217;s face had been went slowly across
to him where he sat. After a while she slipped her
arm about his wasted shoulders, just as she had done
so often on other nights. A racking sob shook her
when she first tried to speak&ndash;&ndash;and she tried again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kept faith, didn&#8217;t you, dear?&#8221; she whispered
to him. &#8220;Oh, but you kept faith with her&ndash;&ndash;right&ndash;&ndash;right
up to the end. Please God&ndash;&ndash;please God, I
may get my chance back again&ndash;&ndash;to try to keep it,
too. You&#8217;ve gone to her&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;m glad! You
waited a long time, dear, and you were very patient.
But, oh, you&#8217;ve left me&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve left me all
alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears came then. Great, searing drops that
had been hopelessly dammed back the night before
rolled down her thin cheeks. She stooped
and touched the silvered head with her lips before
she groped her way into the other room and found
her chair at the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew I was there with him,&#8221; she tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
whisper. &#8220;He knew I was, I know! But I wish I
could tell him I&#8217;m sorry. Oh, I wish I could!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Old Jerry found her so, head pillowed upon
her outstretched arms, her hair in a marvelous shimmering
mass across her little shoulders when he
came the next morning, almost before the day was
fairly begun, to tell her all the things there were
for him to tell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>Monday morning was always a busy morning
in Jesse Hogarty&#8217;s Fourteenth Street
gymnasium; busy, that is to say, along about
that hour when morning was almost ready to slip
into early afternoon. The reason for this late activity
was very easy to understand, too, once one realized
that Hogarty&#8217;s clientele&ndash;&ndash;especially that of his
Monday mornings&ndash;&ndash;was composed quite entirely of
that type of leisurely young man who rarely pointed
the nose of his tub-seated raceabout below Forty-second
Street, except for the benefits of a few rather
desultory rounds under Hogarty&#8217;s tutelage, a shocking
plunge beneath an icy shower, and the all pervading
sense of physical well-being resultant upon a
half hour&#8217;s kneading of none too firm muscles on
the marble slabs.</p>
<p>It was like Jesse Hogarty&ndash;&ndash;or Flash Hogarty, as
he had been styled by the sporting reporters of the
saffron dailies ten years back, when it was said that
he could hit faster and harder out of a clinch than
any lightweight who ever stood in canvas shoes&ndash;&ndash;to
refuse to transfer his place to some locality a bit
nearer Fifty-seventh Street, even when it chanced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
as it did with every passing year, that he drew his
patrons&ndash;&ndash;at an alarmingly high rate per patron&ndash;&ndash;almost
entirely from far uptown.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a turkish bath,&#8221; Flash Hogarty was
accustomed to answer such importunities. &#8220;If you
are just looking for a place to boil out the poison,
hunt around a little&ndash;&ndash;take a wide-eyed look or two!
There are lots and lots of them. This isn&#8217;t a turkish
bath; it&#8217;s a gymnasium&ndash;&ndash;a <i>man&#8217;s</i> gymnasium!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was his invariable formula, alike to the objections
of the youthful, unlimited-of-allowance, more
or less hard-living sons that it &#8220;spoils the best part
of the week, you know, Flash, just running &#8217;way
down here,&#8221; and the equally earnest and far more
peevish complaints of the ticker tired, just-a-minute-to-spare
fathers that it cost them about five thousand,
just to take an hour to work off a few pounds.</p>
<p>But they kept on coming, in spite of their lack of
time and Hogarty&#8217;s calm refusal to consider their
arguments&ndash;&ndash;some of the younger men because they
really did appreciate the sensation of flexible muscles
sliding beneath a smooth skin, some of them merely
because they liked to hear Hogarty&#8217;s fluently picturesque
profanity, always couched in the most delightfully
modulated of English, when the activity
of a particularly giddy week-end brought them back
a little too shaky of hand, a little too brilliant of eye
and a trifle jumpy as to pulse. Hogarty had a way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
of telling them just how little they actually amounted
to, which, no matter how wickedly it cut, never failed
to amuse them.</p>
<p>The older generation dared do nothing else, even
in the face of the ex-lightweight&#8217;s scathingly sarcastic
admiration of their constantly increasing waist-line&ndash;&ndash;or
lack of one. For their lines were largely
a series of curves exactly opposite to those on which
Nature had originally designed them.</p>
<p>They continued to come; they ran down-town in
closed town cars, padded heavily across the sidewalk
like sad bovines going to the slaughter, to reappear
an hour or two later stepping like three-year-olds,
serenely, virtuously joyous at the tale of the scales
which indicated a five-pound loss. And the Saturday
and Sunday week-end out of town which presently
followed, with the astoundingly heavy dinners that
accompanied it, brought them back in a week, sadder
even than before.</p>
<p>Monday morning was always a very busy morning
in Hogarty&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;but never until along about noon. And
because he knew how infallible were the habits of
his patrons, Hogarty did not so much as lift his eyes
to the practically empty gymnasium floor when a clock
at the far side of the room tinkled the hour of eleven.
The two boys who were busily scrubbing with waxing-mops
the floor that already glistened like the
unruffled surface of some crystal pool were quite as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
unconcerned at the lack of activity as was their employer.
They merely paused long enough to draw
one shirt sleeve across the sweat-beaded foreheads&ndash;&ndash;it
was a very early spring in Manhattan and the
first heat was hard to bear&ndash;&ndash;and went at their task
harder than ever.</p>
<p>Hogarty had one other reason that morning which
accounted for his absolute serenity. From Third
Avenue to the waterfront any one who was well-informed
at all&ndash;&ndash;and there was no one who had not
at least heard whispers of his fame&ndash;&ndash;knew that the
thin-faced, hard-eyed, steel-sinewed ex-lightweight
who dressed in almost funeral black and white and
talked in the hushed, measured syllables of a professor
of English, loved one thing even more than he
loved to see his own man put over the winning punch
in&ndash;&ndash;say the tenth. It was common gossip that a set
of ivory dominoes came first before all else.</p>
<p>No man had ever ventured to interrupt twice the
breathless interest with which Hogarty was accustomed
to play his game. It did not promise to be
safe&ndash;&ndash;a second interruption. And Hogarty was
playing dominoes this particular Monday morning,
at a little round, green-topped table against the wall
opposite the door, peering stealthily at the upturning
face of each piece of a newly dealt hand, when
the clock struck off that hour. But if Hogarty was
oblivious to everything but the game, his opponent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
was far from being in that much to be envied state.
Bobby Ogden yawned&ndash;&ndash;yawned from sheer ennui&ndash;&ndash;although
he tried to hide that indication of his boredom
behind a perfectly manicured hand, while he
scowled at the dial.</p>
<p>Ogden was one of the Monday morning regulars&ndash;&ndash;one
of the crowd which usually arrived in a visibly
taut-nerved condition at an entirely irregular
and undependable hour. An attack of malignant malaria,
contracted on a prolonged &#8217;gator hunt in the
Glades, coupled with the equally malignant orders of
his physician, alone accounted for his presence there
at that unheard of o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>There were purplish semi-circles still painfully too
vivid beneath his eyes; his pallor was still tinged with
an ivory-like shade of yellow. And he fidgeted constantly
in the face of Hogarty&#8217;s happy deliberation,
stretching his heliotrope silk-clad arms and tapping
flat, heel-less rubber-soled shoes on the floor beneath
the table in a fashion that would have irritated any
but the blandly unconscious man across the table from
him to a state of violence.</p>
<p>Ogden&#8217;s quite perfectly lined features were smooth
with the smoothness of twenty years or so. His lack
of stability and poise belonged also to that age and
to a physique that managed to tilt the scale beam at
one hundred and eighteen&ndash;&ndash;that is, unless he had
been forgetting rather more rashly than usual that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
liquids were less sustaining than solids, when one
hundred and ten was about the figure.</p>
<p>He was playing poorly that morning&ndash;&ndash;playing inattentively&ndash;&ndash;with
his eyes always waiting for the
hands to indicate that hour which was most likely
to herald the arrival of the advance guard of the
crowd of regulars. Hogarty himself, after a time,
began to feel, vaguely, his uneasiness and lack of
application to the matter in hand, and made evident
his irritation by even longer pauses before each play.
He liked a semblance of opposition at least, and he
lifted his head, scowling a little at Ogden&#8217;s last,
most flagrant blunder, to find that his antagonist
had moved without so much as looking at the piece
he had slipped into position.</p>
<p>The boy wasn&#8217;t looking at the table at all. He
sat twisted about in his chair, staring wide-eyed at
the figure that had pushed open the street door and
was now surveying the whole room with an astonishingly
calm attention to detail. Ogden was staring,
oblivious to everything else, and with real cause,
for the figure that had hesitated on the threshold
was like no other that had ever drifted into Hogarty&#8217;s
place before. His shoulders seemed fairly to fill
the door-frame, for all that bigger men than he was
had stood on that same spot and gone unnoticed because
of size alone. And his waist appeared almost
slender, and his hips very flat, merely from contrast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
with all that weight which he carried high in his chest.</p>
<p>But it was not the possibilities of the newcomer&#8217;s
body that held Ogden&#8217;s fascinated attention. In
point of fact, he did not notice that at all, until some
time later. Denny Bolton&#8217;s long, tanned face was
entirely grave&ndash;&ndash;even graver than usual. Just a hint
of wistfulness that would never quite leave them
showed in his eyes and lurked in the line of his lips&ndash;&ndash;an
intangible, fleeting suggestion of expectation
that had waited patiently for something that had
been very long in the coming. And the black felt
hat and smooth black suit which he wore finished
the picture and made the illusion complete. His
face and figure, even there in the doorway of Hogarty&#8217;s
Fourteenth Street place, could have suggested
but one thing to an observant man. He might have
been a composite of all the New England Pilgrim
Fathers who had ever braved a rock-bound coast.</p>
<p>And Bobby Ogden was observing. Utterly unconscious
of Hogarty&#8217;s threatening storm of protest, he
sat and gazed and gazed, scarcely crediting his own
eyes. Domino poised in hand, Hogarty had turned
in preoccupied resignation back to a perplexed contemplation
of whether it would be better to play a
blank-six and block the game or a double-blank and
risk being caught with a handful of high counters,
when Ogden reached out and clutched him by the
wrist.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shades of Miles Standish!&#8221; that silk-shirted person
gasped. &#8220;In the name of the Mayflower and
John Alden, and hallowed Plymouth Rock, look,
Flash, look! For the love o&#8217; Mike look, before he
moves and spoils the tableau!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty lifted his head and looked.</p>
<p>Denny Bolton&#8217;s eyes had returned from their deliberate
excursion about the gymnasium just in time
to meet halfway that utterly impersonal scrutiny.
For a long moment or two that mutual inspection endured;
then the boy&#8217;s lips moved&ndash;&ndash;open with a smile
that was far graver than his gravity had been&ndash;&ndash;and
he started slowly across the floor toward the table.
Hogarty half rose, one hand outstretched as if to
halt him, but for some reason which the ex-lightweight
scarcely understood himself, he failed to utter
the protest that was at his tongue&#8217;s end. And Young
Denny continued to advance&ndash;&ndash;continued, and left in
the rear a neatly defined trail where the heavy nails
of his shoes marred the sacred sheen of that floor.</p>
<p>Within arm&#8217;s reach of the table he stopped, his
eyes flitting questioningly from Hogarty&#8217;s totally inscrutable
face to the tense interest and enjoyment in
Bobby Ogden&#8217;s features, and back again. Hogarty&#8217;s
hard eyes could be very hard&ndash;&ndash;hard and chilling as
chipped steel&ndash;&ndash;and they were that now. He was
only just beginning to awake to a realization of that
profaned floor, but the smile upon Denny&#8217;s mouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
neither disappeared nor stiffened in embarrassment
before that forbidding countenance. Instead he held
out his hand&ndash;&ndash;a big, long-fingered, hard-palmed hand&ndash;&ndash;toward
the ex-lightweight proprietor. And when
he began to speak there was nothing but simple interrogation
in the almost ponderous voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I reckon,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that you must be
Jesse Hogarty&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Jesse Hogarty?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flash Hogarty looked at him, looked at that outstretched
hand&ndash;&ndash;looked back at his steady eyes and
the smile that parted his lips. And Hogarty did a
thing that made even Bobby Ogden gasp. He bowed
gracefully and reached out and silently shook hands.
When he spoke, instead of the perfectly enunciated,
picturesquely profane rebuke which the silk-shirted
boy was waiting to hear, his voice was even smoother
and softer, and choicer of intonation than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;Quite free from error or
embarrassing mistake, sir. I am Mr. Jesse Hogarty.
You, however, if I may be permitted that assertion,
have me rather at a disadvantage, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed again, once more elaborately graceful.
Bobby Ogden hugged his knees beneath the table,
for he knew from the very suavity of that reply all
that was brewing. Hogarty&#8217;s silken voice went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regrettable, sir, and most awkward. You, no
doubt, have no objection, however, to making the introduction
complete?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>The smile still hovered upon Denny&#8217;s lips. Ogden
noted, though, that it had changed. And he realized,
too, that it had not been a particularly mirthful
smile, even in the first place. Again Young Denny&#8217;s
eyes met those of the other boy for one moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Denny Bolton,&#8221; he replied just as deliberately.
&#8220;Denny Bolton, from Boltonwood&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;or I
reckon you&#8217;ve never heard of that place. I&#8217;m down
from the hill country, back in the north,&#8221; he supplemented.</p>
<p>Hogarty turned away&ndash;&ndash;turned back to the green-topped
table and played the double-blank with delicate
precision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he agreed softly. &#8220;Quite right&ndash;&ndash;quite
right! And&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;may I inquire if it was something
of importance&ndash;&ndash;something directly concerning
me&ndash;&ndash;which has resulted in this neighborly call?&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not so much as lift his eyes from the dominoes
beneath his fingers. If he had he would have
seen, as Ogden saw, that Denny&#8217;s smile faded away&ndash;&ndash;disappeared
entirely. But when he replied the
boy&#8217;s voice was unchanged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s it&#8217;s particularly important to you,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I came down for&ndash;&ndash;to
see. I was directed&ndash;&ndash;back a day or two I was told
that maybe if I looked you up you&#8217;d have some
opening for me, down here. I was told you were
looking for a&ndash;&ndash;a good heavyweight fighter!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>Bobby Ogden threw back his head to laugh. And
instead he just sat there with his mouth wide open,
waiting. He felt sure that there was a better moment
coming. Hogarty fiddled with the dominoes
and seemed to be considering that information with
due deliberation and from every angle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he murmured at last. &#8220;Surely. Quite
right&ndash;&ndash;quite right! And I may, I believe, safely
assure you that I have several fine openings in the
establishment for young men&ndash;&ndash;for just the right sort
of young men, of course. May I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;inquire if
you wish employment by the&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;week, or just in
your spare time, to put it so?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was icily sarcastic. Denny&#8217;s answer
came sharp upon its heels. His voice was just as
measured, just as inflectionless as Hogarty&#8217;s had
been.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hire them here by the week,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or
for their spare time, I&ndash;&ndash;I reckon I&#8217;ve come to the
wrong establishment. I was only asking you for a
chance to show you whether I was any good or not.
I was told you&#8217;d be just as interested to find out as
I was myself. Maybe&ndash;&ndash;maybe I&#8217;ve made a bad mistake!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby Ogden was sorry he had waited to laugh.
There was a hardness in the big-shouldered figure&#8217;s
words that he did not like; a directly simple, unmistakable
rebuke for the sneer concealed in Hogarty&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
question that could not be misinterpreted. And
something utterly bad flared up in the lean-faced
black-clad proprietor&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;something of enmity
that seemed to Ogden all out of proportion with the
provocation. All the smooth suavity disappeared
from his speech just as chalk marks are wiped out
by a wet sponge. And Hogarty came swiftly to his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you were&ndash;&ndash;maybe you did make a bad
mistake!&#8221; he rasped out in a dead, colorless monotone
that scarcely moved his lips. &#8220;But no man ever
came into this place yet, and went out again to say
he didn&#8217;t get his chance. I know a few specimens
who make a profession of pleading that. They&#8217;re
quitters&ndash;&ndash;and they assay a streak of yellow that isn&#8217;t
pay dirt!&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice dropped in register. It just missed being
hoarse. With a rapidity that was almost bewildering
he began to give orders to the two boys who
were still phlegmatically waxing the floor. And the
English-professor intonation was gone entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Joe!&#8221; he called, &#8220;get out the rods; set &#8217;em up
and rope her off! Legs, you chase out and find Sutton,
if he&#8217;s not in back. You&#8217;ll run into him at Sharp&#8217;s,
most likely. Tell him to come a-running. Tell him a
new one&#8217;s drifted in from the frontier&ndash;&ndash;and thinks
he needs to be shown. Move, you shrimp!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had finished speaking he had started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
toward the locker rooms at the rear. Denny he ignored
as though he did not exist. He went without
a sound in his rubber-soled shoes. Bobby Ogden,
waking suddenly from his trancelike condition, leaped
to his feet and ran after him. Hogarty halted at the
pressure of the boy&#8217;s pink-nailed fingers on his arm
and wheeled to show a face that was startlingly white
and strained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you great big kid!&#8221; Bobby Ogden flung
at him. &#8220;You big infant! You&#8217;re really sore! Don&#8217;t
you know he didn&#8217;t mean anything. He&#8217;s only a kid
himself&ndash;&ndash;and you egged him into it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>From that gently rising inflection alone Ogden
knew that interference was absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he? Well, he&#8217;s old enough to seem to know
what he wants. And he&#8217;s going to get it&ndash;&ndash;see? He&#8217;s
going to get it&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;get&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;good! No man
ever flung it into my face that I didn&#8217;t give him a
chance&ndash;&ndash;not and got away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty glanced meaningly down at the restraining
hand upon his sleeve and Ogden removed it hastily.
He stood in dismayed indecision until the ex-lightweight
had disappeared before he turned toward
Young Denny, who had been watching in silence
his effort at intervention. Denny had not moved.
Ogden&#8217;s almost girlishly modeled face was more than
apprehensive as he stepped up to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad,&#8221; he stated flatly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got him
peeved for keeps. And I guess you&#8217;ve let yourself in
for quite a merry little session, too, unless&ndash;&ndash;unless&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
hesitated, peering curiously in Denny&#8217;s grave face,
&#8220;unless you want to make a nice quiet little exit before
he comes back with Sutton. You can, you know,
and&ndash;&ndash;and it may save you quite a little&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;discomfort
in the long run. Sutton&ndash;&ndash;well, the least I can
say of Sutton is that he&#8217;s inclined to be a trifle rough!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ogden saw that slow smile returning; he saw it
start far back in the steady eyes and spread until
it touched the corners of the other boy&#8217;s lips again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&ndash;&ndash;leave?&#8221; Young Denny asked.</p>
<p>Ogden nodded significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I do mean&ndash;&ndash;only a great deal
more so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t very well do that now&ndash;&ndash;could
I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The silk-shirted shoulders shrugged hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you ask me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;judging from
what I&#8217;ve already seen of your methods, I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d say
most emphatically no. I&#8217;ve done all I can when I
advise you that now is the one best hour to make
your getaway. It wouldn&#8217;t be exactly a glorious retreat
from the field, but it wouldn&#8217;t be so painful,
either. Just remember that, will you? I&#8217;m to fit
you out with some fighting togs, I suppose, if you&#8217;ll
just come along.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>He turned to follow in the direction which Hogarty
had taken, and then paused once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon for the omission, Mr. Bolton,&#8221; he
added, and he smiled boyishly. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Ogden&ndash;&ndash;Bobby
Ogden. Glad to become acquainted with
you, I&#8217;m sure. And now, if you will follow on, I&#8217;ll
do my best for you. Would you mind walking on
your toes? You see, there are just two things most
calculated to get Flash&#8217;s goat. One of &#8217;em&#8217;s marring
up his floor with heavy boots, and the other is
butting in when he&#8217;s playing dominoes. You couldn&#8217;t
have known it, of course, but he can&#8217;t stand for either
of them. And together I am afraid they have got
you in pretty bad. You&#8217;re sure you can&#8217;t swallow
your pride, and just beat it quietly while the chance
is nice and handy? Maybe you ought to think of
your family&ndash;&ndash;no?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny&#8217;s smile widened. He shook his head in refusal.
He knew he was going to like Ogden&ndash;&ndash;like
him for the same reason that he had liked the fat,
brown-clad newspaper man in Boltonwood&ndash;&ndash;because
of the charming equality of his attitude and the frankness
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he decided, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t
mean to stir him up so, either, only&ndash;&ndash;only I thought,
just for a minute or two, that he was laughing at me.
I think I&#8217;d rather stay and see it out. But you mustn&#8217;t
worry about me&ndash;&ndash;I wouldn&#8217;t if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>Again Ogden shrugged resignedly. On tiptoe Denny
followed him to the locker-rooms in the rear, and
at a word of direction began to remove his clothes.
While he plunged head-foremost into a bin in search
for a pair of white trunks, Ogden kept up a steady
stream of advice calculated to save the other at
least a small percentage of punishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sutton&#8217;s big,&#8221; he exclaimed jerkily, head out of
sight, &#8220;but he isn&#8217;t fast on his feet. That&#8217;s why they
call him Boots. He steps around as though he had
on waders&ndash;&ndash;hip-high ones. But he&#8217;s lightning hitting
from close in&ndash;&ndash;in-fighting they call it&ndash;&ndash;where
most big fighters don&#8217;t shine. That&#8217;s because he&#8217;s
had Flash&#8217;s coaching. You want to keep away from
him&ndash;&ndash;keep him at arm&#8217;s length, and maybe he won&#8217;t
do too much harm. I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d let him do all the leading,
if I were you, and&ndash;&ndash;and kind of run ahead of him.&#8221;
The voice came half-smothered from the cluttered bin
of equipment. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t running away from him
because you&#8217;re afraid, you understand. It&#8217;s just playing
him to tire him out, you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was silent for a moment while Bobby Ogden
burrowed for the necessary canvas shoes. Then a
hushed laugh broke that quiet and brought the
latter bolt upright. With the trunks in one hand
and the rubber-soled slippers in the other, Ogden
stood and stared, only half understanding that the
big boy before him was laughing at him for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
solicitude and trying to reassure him with that
same mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny, is it?&#8221; he snorted aggrievedly. &#8220;So very&ndash;&ndash;very&ndash;&ndash;funny?
Well, I only hope you&#8217;ll be able
to laugh that way again&ndash;&ndash;say even in a month or
two!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t laughing at you,&#8221; Young Denny told him
soberly. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I was just thinking how strange it
seemed to have somebody worried over me&ndash;&ndash;worried
because they were afraid I might get hurt. Most
little mix-ups I&#8217;ve gone into have worried folks&ndash;&ndash;lest
I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII' id='CHAPTER_XIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>When he had first looked up from the green-topped
table and seen him standing there in
the entrance of the gymnasium Ogden had
only sensed the bigness of Denny Bolton&#8217;s body&ndash;&ndash;only
vaguely felt the promise which his smooth black
suit concealed. It was the face that had interested
him most at that moment, and yet he had not even
noticed the half healed cut that ran almost to the point
of the chin. Young Denny&#8217;s grave explanation of his
quiet mirth caused him to look closer&ndash;&ndash;made him
really wonder now what had been its cause. There
was a frankly inquisitive question half-formed behind
his lips, but when he turned to find Denny sitting
stripped to the waist, waiting for the garments which
he held in his hands, he merely stood and stared.
Bobby Ogden had seen many men stripped for the
ring. It took more than an ordinary man to make
him look even once&ndash;&ndash;but he could not take his eyes off
this boy before him. Once he whistled softly between
his teeth in unconcealed amazement; once he walked
entirely around him, exclaiming softly to himself.
Then he remembered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, get into these,&#8221; he ordered abruptly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and thrust the things into Denny&#8217;s waiting hands.</p>
<p>While Denny was obeying he continued to circle
and to admire critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man&ndash;&ndash;man!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;But you&#8217;re sure
put together right!&#8221; He was silent for a moment
while he punched back and shoulders with a searching
thumb. &#8220;Silk and steel,&#8221; he went on to himself.
&#8220;And not a lump&ndash;&ndash;not a single knot! Oh, if you only
knew how to use it; if you only knew the moves,
wouldn&#8217;t we give Flash the heart-break of his life!
Now wouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny finished lacing his flat shoes and stood
erect, and even Ogden&#8217;s chattering tongue was silent.
It was very easy now to see why that big body had
seemed shoulder-heavy. From the shoulder points
the lines ran unbroken, almost wedgelike, to his ankles.
He was flat and slim in the waist as any stripling
might have been. All hint of bulkiness was
gone. He seemed almost slender, until one started to
analyze each dimension singly, such as the breadth
of his back, or the depth of his chest. Then one realized
that it was only the slimness of fine-drawn ankles,
the swelling smoothness of hidden sinews which
created that impression. And Ogden&#8217;s quick eye
caught that instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have said one-ninety,&#8221; he stated judicially.
&#8220;At least as much as that, or a
shade better, before you undressed. Now I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
put it under&ndash;&ndash;what do you weigh, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>He slid the weight over the bar after Young Denny
had stepped upon the white scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;One sixty-five&ndash;&ndash;sixty-eight&ndash;&ndash;seventy, and a trifle
over,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;Man, but you&#8217;re built for speed!
You ought to be lightning fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant the boy called Legs opened the
door and thrust in his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chief says if you&#8217;re coming at all,&#8221; he droned
apathetically, &#8220;you might just as well come
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ogden threw a long bathrobe over his charge&#8217;s
shoulders as the latter started forward. He wanted
to note the effect which the sudden display of that
pair of shoulders and set of back muscles would have
upon Flash Hogarty&#8217;s temper. As they crossed the
long room Denny&#8217;s grave lack of concern was made
to seem almost stolid in contrast with the heliotrope
silk-shirted boy&#8217;s excessive nervousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now remember what I told you,&#8221; he whispered
hoarsely. &#8220;Keep away from him&ndash;&ndash;keep away and
let him do the rushing&ndash;&ndash;for he&#8217;s got a punch that&#8217;s
sudden death! You can tire him out. He&#8217;s old and
his wind is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brass rods had been set up in their sockets in
the floor and the space which they outlined in the
middle of the room roped off and carpeted with a
square of hard, brown canvas. The man called Boots
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Sutton was already in his corner, waiting, and his attitude
toward the whole affair was very patently
that of sheer boredom. He barely lifted his eyes
as Young Denny crawled through the ropes at the
opposite corner, behind the officiously fluttering Ogden.
This was merely part of his every day&#8217;s work;
he spent hours each week either instructing frankly
confessed amateurs or discouraging too-confident,
would-be professionals. It was only because of the
strangely venomous harshness with which Hogarty
had given him his orders while he was himself dressing
that he vouchsafed Denny even that one glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to get him,&#8221; Hogarty snarled. &#8220;I
want you to get him right from the jump&ndash;&ndash;and get
him!&ndash;&ndash;and keep on getting him! Either make him
squeal&ndash;&ndash;make him quit&ndash;&ndash;or beat him to death!&#8221;</p>
<p>But if Sutton failed to note the play of those muscles
that bunched and quivered and ran like live
things beneath the skin of the boy&#8217;s back, when Bobby
Ogden threw off the enveloping wrap with an ostentatious
flourish and knelt to lace on his gloves, that
disclosure was not entirely lost upon Hogarty.
Watching from the corners of his eyes, Bobby saw
him scowl and chew his lip as his head came forward
a little. And immediately he turned to speak again
in a whisper to Boots, squatting nonchalantly in his
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need, mind, of being careless,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
cautioned. &#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he might have a punch, you know,
at that. Some of &#8217;em do&ndash;&ndash;a lucky one once in a
while. Just watch him a trifle&ndash;&ndash;and hand it to him
good!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sutton nodded and rose to his feet. Watch in
hand, Hogarty vaulted the ropes, and Ogden, with
a last whispered admonition, bundled up the bathrobe
and scuttled from the ring.</p>
<p>At that moment Young Denny&#8217;s bulkily slender
body was even more deceptive. Sutton, even when
trained to his finest, would have outweighed him
twenty pounds. Now that margin was nearer thirty,
and added to that, he was inches less in height. He
was shorter of neck, blocky, built close to the ground.
And the span of his ankle was nearly as great as
that of Denny&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>Comparing them with detail-hungry eyes, Bobby
Ogden saw, however, that from the waist up the boy&#8217;s
clean, swelling body totally shadowed the other&#8217;s
knotted bulk; he noted that, with arm outstretched,
heel of glove against Sutton&#8217;s chin, Denny&#8217;s reach
was more than great enough to hold the other away
from him. Hard on the heels of that thought came
the realization that that was a fine point of the game
utterly outside of the boy&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p>It was quiet&ndash;&ndash;oddly, peacefully quiet for a second&ndash;&ndash;in
that long room. Then in obedience to a nod
from Hogarty the lanky boy called Legs languidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
touched a bell, and all that peaceful silence was shattered
to bits. Ogden shouted aloud, without knowing
it, a shrill, dismayed cry of warning, as Sutton
catapulted from his corner; he shouted and shut his
eyes and winced as if that rushing attack had been
launched at himself. But he opened them again&ndash;&ndash;opened
them at the sound of a sickening smash of
glove against flesh&ndash;&ndash;to see Denny blink both
eyes as his whole body rebounded from that
blow.</p>
<p>Ogden waited, forgetting to breathe, for the boy
to go down; he waited to see his knees weaken and
his shoulders slump forward. But instead of shriveling
before that pile-driver swing, he realized that
Denny somehow was weathering the storm of blows
that followed it; that somehow he had managed to
keep his feet and was backing away, trying to follow
faithfully his instructions.</p>
<p>Just as Ogden had pictured it would be, it all happened.
Foot by foot Sutton drove him around the
ring. There was no opening for Denny to return a
blow&ndash;&ndash;nothing but a maze of battering fists to be
blocked and ducked and covered. Even the speed,
the natural speed of lithe muscles for which Bobby
had hoped, and hopelessly expected, was entirely
lacking in every motion. Heavy-footed, ponderous,
Young Denny gave way before that attack. Sutton,
always reputed slow, was terribly, brutally swift of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
movement in comparison with the boy&#8217;s faltering uncertainty.</p>
<p>Twice and a third time in the first minute of fighting
Boots feinted aside his guard with what seemed
childish ease and then drove his glove against the
other&#8217;s unprotected face. Time after time he repeated
the blow, and at each sickening smack that answered
the crash of leather against flesh Bobby Ogden
gasped aloud and marveled. For at each jolt Denny
merely blinked his eyes as he recoiled&ndash;&ndash;blinked, and
retreated a little more slowly than before.</p>
<p>At the bell Ogden was through the ropes and
dragging him to his corner. A little trickle of blood
was gathering on the point of Denny&#8217;s chin where the
glove had opened afresh the half-healed cut on his
cheek; he was shaking his head as he waved aside
the wet towel in Ogden&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, but you&#8217;re some bear for punishment!&#8221; Ogden
chattered, strangely weak himself beneath his
belt. &#8220;If you only had a little speed&ndash;&ndash;just a little!
Why, he sent over a dozen to your chin that ought
to have laid you away. But you&#8217;re playing him right!
You&#8217;re working him, and if you can manage to hang
on you&#8217;ll get him in the end. Just keep away&ndash;&ndash;keep
away and let him wear himself out. But&ndash;&ndash;oh, if you
did have it. Just one real punch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny continued to shake his head&ndash;&ndash;continued
to shake it doggedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do&ndash;&ndash;do you mean that that is as hard as he is
likely to hit?&#8221; he queried slowly. &#8220;Do you mean&ndash;&ndash;he
was really trying&ndash;&ndash;hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ogden stopped urging the wet towel upon him and
stood and gazed at him with something close akin
to awe in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard!&#8221; he echoed in a small voice. &#8220;Hard!
How hard do you expect a man to hit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your plan was wrong,&#8221; Young Denny told
him. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he hastened to soften that abrupt
statement, &#8220;of course it would work all right, only&ndash;&ndash;only
I&#8217;m not much good at that kind of fancy work.
I&ndash;&ndash;I just have to wade right in, when I want to do
any damage, because I&#8217;m slow getting away from a
man. I can&#8217;t punch&ndash;&ndash;not hard&ndash;&ndash;when I&#8217;m backing
off. But now I aim to show you how hard I expect a
man to hit, just as soon as they ring that bell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty was leaning over Sutton in the opposite
corner, frowning and talking rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Boots?&#8221; he demanded anxiously.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t lost your kick, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sutton gazed contemplatively down at his gloved
hands and up again into his employer&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d you say that guy was?&#8221; he countered.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s he blowed in from&ndash;&ndash;again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A rube&ndash;&ndash;down from the hills he called it. Just
some come-on,&#8221; Hogarty repeated his former information,
&#8220;who thinks because he&#8217;s cleaned up main
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
street and licked the village blacksmith that he&#8217;s a
world-beater. Why, Boots? You aren&#8217;t worried,
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The contemplative gleam in Sutton&#8217;s eyes deepened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he stated thoughtfully, &#8220;just because
there&#8217;s some mistake&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;or he&#8217;s made of brass.
I&ndash;&ndash;I hit him pretty hard, Flash&ndash;&ndash;and do you know
what he done? Well, he blinked. He&ndash;&ndash;blinked&ndash;&ndash;at&ndash;&ndash;me.
I never hit any man harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty&#8217;s face had lost a little of its inscrutability.
He flashed one sharp glance across at Young Denny
in the other corner as he stepped back out of the
ring and his frown deepened a little after that brief
scrutiny. For the boy&#8217;s body, squatting there, crouched
waiting for the bell, was taut in every sinew, quivering
with eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You just failed to place &#8217;em right, I guess,&#8221; he
reassured Boots. &#8220;Take a little more time, and get
him flush on the bone. You can slow up a little.
He isn&#8217;t even fast enough to run away from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Hogarty nodded to the boy called Legs, and
again the gong rang. Five minutes earlier it would
have been hard for Bobby Ogden to have explained
just what it was which he had half dreamed might
lurk in those rippling muscles that bunched and ran
beneath Denny&#8217;s white skin. For want of a better
name he had named it speed. And now, at the tap of
the bell, he watched and recognized.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>Swift as was Sutton&#8217;s savage rush across the canvas,
he had hardly left his corner in the ropes before
Young Denny was upon him. The boy lifted and
sprang and dropped cat-footed in the middle of the
ring, hunched of shoulder and bent of knee to meet
the shocking impact. It was bewilderingly rapid&ndash;&ndash;terrifyingly
effortless&ndash;&ndash;this explosive, spontaneous
answer of every muscle to the call of the brain. Just
as before, Sutton feinted and saw his opening and
swung. Young Denny knew only one best way to
fight; he knew only that he had to take a blow in
order to give one, and Sutton&#8217;s fist shot home against
his unprotected chin. He blinked with the shock,
just as he had blinked before, and swayed back a
little. Sutton had swung hard&ndash;&ndash;he had swung from
his heels&ndash;&ndash;and he was still following that blow
through when Denny snapped forward again.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a long swing, but it was wickedly quick.
From the waist it started, a short, vicious jolt that
carried all the boy&#8217;s weight behind it, and the instant
that Denny whipped it over Sutton&#8217;s chin seemed to
come out to meet it&ndash;&ndash;seemed almost to lift to receive
it. And then, as his head leaped back, even before
his body had lifted from the floor, the boy&#8217;s other
hand drove across and set him spinning in the air
as he fell. He went down sideways, a long, crashing
fall that dropped him limp in the corner which he
had just left.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>For a moment Denny crouched waiting for him to
rise. Then he realized that Sutton would not rise
again&ndash;&ndash;not for a time. He saw Hogarty leap over
the ropes and kneel&ndash;&ndash;saw the boy Legs rush across
with ammonia and water&ndash;&ndash;and he understood. Ogden
was at his side, pounding him upon the shoulder
and shrieking in his ear. His eyes lifted from the
face of the fallen man to that of the heliotrope silk-shirted
person beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not really badly hurt, is he?&#8221; he inquired
slowly. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t hit him&ndash;&ndash;too hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ogden ceased for a moment thumping him on the
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt!&#8221; he yelped. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t hit him too hard!
Why, man, he&#8217;s stiff, right now. He&#8217;s ready for the
coroner! Gad&ndash;&ndash;and I was pitying you&ndash;&ndash;I was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny shook him off and crossed and knelt
beside the kneeling Hogarty. And at that moment
Sutton opened his eyes again and stared dully into
the ex-lightweight&#8217;s face. After a time recognition
began to dawn in that gaze&ndash;&ndash;understanding&ndash;&ndash;comprehension.
Once it shifted to Denny, and then came
back again. He made several futile efforts before he
could make his lips frame the words.</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;Amateur,&#8221; he muttered, and he managed
to rip one glove from a limp hand and hurl it from
him as he struggled to sit erect. &#8220;Amateur&ndash;&ndash;hell!
A-a-a-h, Flash, what&#8217;re you tryin&#8217; to hand me?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Denny had begun to get back into his clothes,
pausing now and then to dabble tentatively
at the freshly broken bruise with the wet
towel which Ogden had at last forced him to accept,
when the door of the dressing-room opened, and
Hogarty stepped briskly inside and closed the door
behind him.</p>
<p>The ex-lightweight ignored entirely the covertly
delighted grin that lit up Bobby Ogden&#8217;s features
at his appearance. His own too-pale, too-thin lips
were curved in a ghost of a smile; his face had lost
all its dangerous tautness, but the greatest change of
all lay there in his eyes. Their flaring antagonism
had burnt itself out. And when Hogarty spoke it
was once more in his smoothly perfect, delightfully
measured, best professor-of-English style, for all
that his opening remark was couched in the vernacular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Bolton,&#8221; he began to the boy sitting quiet
before him, &#8220;it looks as though we would have to
hand it to you&ndash;&ndash;which I earnestly desire you to believe
I am now doing, with both hands. It may
eventually prove that I lost a most valuable assistant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
through this morning&#8217;s little flurry. I am not
quite certain yet as to that as Boots is not sufficiently
himself to give the matter judicious consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;He still thinks I crossed him for the entertainment&#8217;s
sake&ndash;&ndash;which is of little immediate importance.
What I did come in for was to listen to anything at
all that you may have to tell me. You&#8217;ll admit, of
course, that while your explanation as to your errand
was strictly to the point, it was scarcely comprehensive.
My own unfortunate temper was, no doubt,
largely the cause of your brevity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment, clearing his throat and
gazing blankly at the grinning Ogden.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Ogden here has of course told you, I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;well,
rather touchy when interrupted at my favorite pastime,
and especially so when I am trying to get a
few minutes relaxation with a pin-headed person who
insists upon playing without watching the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you spoke of wanting an opportunity of&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;entering
the game professionally. I&#8217;m not admitting
you&#8217;re a world-beater, understand&ndash;&ndash;or anything
like that! You&#8217;ve just succeeded in putting away a
man who was as formidable as the best of them,
five years ago. And five years isn&#8217;t today, by any
means. I&#8217;ve been looking for a real possibility to
appear for so long that I&#8217;ve grown exceedingly sensitive
at each fresh failure. And yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet, if
you did have the stuff&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>Again he stopped and Denny, watching, saw the
proprietor&#8217;s face glow suddenly with a savage sort
of exultation. His eyes, half-veiled behind drooping
lids that twitched a little, went unseeingly over the
boy&#8217;s head as though they were visualizing a triumph
so long anticipated that it had become almost a lost
hope. Again that promise of something ominous
blackened the pupils&ndash;&ndash;something totally dangerous
that harmonized perfectly with the snarl upon his
lips.</p>
<p>Hogarty&#8217;s whole attitude was that of a man who
wanted to believe and yet who, because he knew
that the very measure of his eagerness made him
doubly easy to convince, had resolved not to let himself
accept one spurious proof. And all his skepticism
was shot through and through with hate&ndash;&ndash;a
deadly, patient sort of hatred for someone which was
as easy to see as it was hard for the big-shouldered
boy to understand.</p>
<p>There was craft in the ex-lightweight&#8217;s bearing&ndash;&ndash;a
gentleness almost stealthy when he leaned forward
a little, as if he feared that the first abrupt move or
word on his part would frighten away that timid
hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that you said some one sent you. You&ndash;&ndash;you
did not mention the name?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny leaned over and picked up his coat from a
chair beside the bench, searching the pockets until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
he found the card which the plump, brown-clad newspaper
man had given him. Without a word he
reached out and put it in Hogarty&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>It bore Jesse Hogarty&#8217;s Fourteenth Street address
across its face. Hogarty turned it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Introducing the Pilgrim,&#8221; ran the caption in the
cramped handwriting of Chub Morehouse&#8217;s stubby
fingers. And, beneath, that succinct sentence which
was not so cryptic after all:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them may have science, and some of them
may have speed, but after all it&#8217;s the man who can
take punishment who gets the final decision. Call me
up, if this ever comes to hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very deliberately Hogarty deciphered the words,
lifted a vaguely puzzled face to Young Denny, who
waited immobile&ndash;&ndash;and then returned again to the
card. He even nodded once in thorough appreciation
of the title which Morehouse had given the boy;
he smiled faintly as he remembered Denny as he had
stood there in the entrance of the big room, a short
while before, and realized how apt the phrase was.
Then he began to whistle, a shrill, faint, monotonous
measure, the calculating glitter in his eyes growing
more and more brilliant.</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he murmured thoughtfully. &#8220;So-o-o!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, to Denny:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there&ndash;&ndash;did he make any comment in particular,
when he gave you this?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;made several,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;He said
that there was a man at that address&ndash;&ndash;meaning you&ndash;&ndash;that
would fall on my neck and weep, if I happened
to have the stuff. And he warned me, too, not
to think that Jed The Red fought like a school boy,
just because he was a second-rater&ndash;&ndash;because he didn&#8217;t,
nothing like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty laughed aloud. That sudden, staccato
chuckle was almost startling coming from his pale
lips. It hushed just as quickly as it had begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed The Red, eh?&#8221; he reiterated softly, and he
began tapping the card with his fingertips. &#8220;I see,
or at least I am commencing to get a glimmer of those
possibilities which Mr. Morehouse may have had
in mind. And now I think the one best thing to do
would be to call him up, as he has here requested. As
soon as you finish dressing Ogden here will show
you the rest of the works, if you&#8217;d care to look around
a little. It is entirely likely that we shall want to
talk with you directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled abruptly toward Ogden who had been
listening without a word, the broad grin never leaving
his lips. It was the silk-shirted boy to whom Hogarty
addressed the rest of that sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; he said, and his voice shed with
astounding completeness all its syllabled nicety. &#8220;You
try to make yourself useful as well as pestilential.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Get him a bit of adhesive for that cut. It looks as
bad as though a horse had kicked him there.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the rest of your mob will be swarming in
here in a few minutes, too. You can tell them that
Sutton is&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;indisposed this morning, and that
they&#8217;ll have to play by themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded briefly to Denny and opened the door.
But he stopped again before he passed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one other question, Mr. Bolton,&#8221; he said
over his shoulder. &#8220;And please believe that I am
not usually so inquisitive. But I&#8217;m more than a little
curious to know why you did not present this card
first&ndash;&ndash;and go through the little informal examination
I arranged for you afterward? It would have insured
you a far different reception. Was there any
special reason, or did you just overlook it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Denny dabbed again at the red drop on his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t exactly forget it,&#8221; he stated ponderously.
&#8220;But, you see, I kind of thought if I just
told you first that I wanted to see if I had any chance,
you wouldn&#8217;t make any allowances for me because
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty&#8217;s second nod which cut him short was
the quintessence of crisp satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; he cut in. &#8220;Perfectly! And quite
right&ndash;&ndash;quite right!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ex-lightweight proprietor was sitting with his
chin clasped in both palms, still staring at the half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
facetious words of introduction which the plump newspaper
man had penciled across that card, when the
door of the small office in the front of the gymnasium
was pushed open a crack, some scant fifteen minutes
after his peremptory summons had gone out over the
wire, and made him lift his head.</p>
<p>His eyes were filmed with a preoccupation too profound
to be dispelled by the mock anxiety upon the
chubby round countenance which Morehouse thrust
through that small aperture between door and frame,
or his excessively overdone caution as he swung the
door wider and tiptoed over the threshold, to stand
and point a rigidly stubby finger behind him at the
trail of nail prints which Young Denny&#8217;s shoes had
left across the glistening wax an hour or so earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesse,&#8221; he whispered hoarsely, &#8220;some one has
perpetrated here upon the sacred sheen of your floor
a dastardly outrage! I merely want you to note, before
you start running the guilty one to earth, that
I am making my entrance entirely in accordance with
your oft-reiterated instructions. I am not he!&#8221;</p>
<p>For all the change which it brought about in Hogarty&#8217;s
face that greeting might have been left unspoken.
He vouchsafed the fat man&#8217;s elaborate pantomime
not so much as the shadow of a smile, nodded
once, thoughtfully, and let his eyes fall again to the
card between his elbows on the table-top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Chub,&#8221; he invited shortly. &#8220;Come in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
And as a clamor of many voices in the outer entrance
heralded the arrival of the rest of Ogden&#8217;s crowd:
&#8220;Here comes the mob now. Come in and close the
door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morehouse, still from head to toe a symphony in
many-toned browns, shed every shred of his facetiousness
at Hogarty&#8217;s crisply repeated invitation. He
closed the door and snapped the catch that made it
fast before he crossed, without a word, and drew a
chair up to the opposite side of the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hurry call just caught me as I was leaving
for lunch,&#8221; he explained then. &#8220;And I made pretty
fair time getting down here, too. What&#8217;s the dark
secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>The black-clad proprietor lifted his lean jaw from
his hands and gazed long and steadily into the newspaper
man&#8217;s eyes, picked up the bit of pasteboard
which bore the latter&#8217;s own name across its front and
flipped it silently across the table to him. Morehouse
took it up gingerly and read it&ndash;&ndash;reversed it and read
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice little touch, that,&#8221; he averred finally. &#8220;Rather
neat and tasty, if I do say it myself. &#8216;Introducing
The Pilgrim!&#8217; Hum-m-m. You can&#8217;t quite appreciate
it of course, but&ndash;&ndash;oh, Flash, I wish you could
have seen that big boy standing there in the door
of that little backwoods tavern, just as I saw him,
about a week ago! Why, he&ndash;&ndash;he was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s come!&#8221; Hogarty cut in briefly.</p>
<p>Morehouse&#8217;s chin dropped. He sat with mouth
agape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;He&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s come where?&#8221;</p>
<p>Where his facetiousness had failed him Morehouse&#8217;s
round-eyed astonishment, a little tinged with
panic, was more than successful. Hogarty permitted
himself to smile a trifle&ndash;&ndash;his queer, strained smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is here,&#8221; he repeated gravely, and the words
were couched in his choicest accents. &#8220;He came in,
perhaps, an hour ago. That is his monogramed
trail across the floor which caught your eye. Oh, he&#8217;s
here&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t doubt that! I&#8217;ll give you a little review
of the manner of his coming, after you tell me
how you ever happened to send him&ndash;&ndash;why you gave
him that card? What&#8217;s the answer to it, Chub?&#8221;</p>
<p>That same light of savage hope and cruelly calculating
enmity, all so strangely mixed with a persistent
doubt, which Young Denny had seen flare up
in the ex-lightweight&#8217;s eyes a little while before, back
in the dressing-room, began to creep once more across
Hogarty&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how long I&#8217;ve been waiting for one
to come along, Chub,&#8221; he went on, almost hoarsely.
&#8220;You know how I&#8217;ve looked for the man who could
do what none of the others have done yet, even though
he is only a second-rater. Twice I thought I had a
newcomer who could put The Red away&ndash;&ndash;and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
him away for keeps&ndash;&ndash;and I just fooled myself because
I was so anxious to believe. I&#8217;ve grown a trifle
wary, Chub, just a trifle! Now, I&#8217;d like to hear you
talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Morehouse sat and fingered that card for a long
time in absolute silence&ndash;&ndash;a silence that was heavy
with embarrassment on his part. He understood,
without need of explanation, for whom that chill
hatred glowed in the spare ex-lightweight&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;knew
the full reason for it. And because he knew
Hogarty, too, as few men had ever come to know
him, he had often assured himself that he was thankful
not to be the man who had earned it.</p>
<p>That knowledge had been very vividly present
when, a few days before, on the platform of the
Boltonwood station, he had requested Denny Bolton
to give him back his card for a moment, after listening
to the boy&#8217;s grave explanation of the raw wound
across his cheek, and on a quite momentary impulse
written across its back that short sentence which was
so meaty with meaning. Every detail of Hogarty&#8217;s
country-wide search for a man who could whip Jed
The Red was an open secret, so far as he was concerned;
he was familiar with all the bitterness of
every fresh disappointment, but he had never seen
Hogarty&#8217;s face so alive with exultant hope as it was
at that moment.</p>
<p>And Morehouse was embarrassed and sorry, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
ashamed, too, of what seemed now must have been
a weak surrender to an impulse which, after all, could
have been born of nothing but a too keen sense of
humor. Hogarty&#8217;s face was more than eager. It
was white and strained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flash,&#8221; he began at last, ludicrously uncomfortable,
&#8220;Flash, I&#8217;m sorry I wrote this, for I always told
you that if I ever did send any one to you he&#8217;d be a
live one and worth your trouble. Right this minute
I can&#8217;t tell why I did it, either, unless I am one of
those naturally dangerous idiots with a perverted
sense of what is really funny. Or maybe I didn&#8217;t
believe he&#8217;d ever get any farther from home than
he was that morning when I gave him this card. That
must have been it, I suppose. Because I never saw
him in action. Why, I never so much as saw him
kick a dog!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you because I don&#8217;t want you to be
disappointed again&ndash;&ndash;and yet I have to tell you, too,
that right at the time I wrote this stuff, Flash, just
for a minute or two, I believe I did almost think he
might be an answer to your riddle. Maybe that was
because he had already licked Jed The Red once, and
I should judge, made a very thorough job of it at that.
That must have influenced me some. But let me tell
you all the story and maybe you&#8217;ll understand a little
better&ndash;&ndash;something that I can&#8217;t say for myself right
at this very instant.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>Morehouse began at the very beginning, looking
oftener at the card between his fingers than at Hogarty&#8217;s
too brilliant eyes, which were fairly burning
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, Flash,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;you know
as well as I do that The Red isn&#8217;t a real champion
and never will be. He has the build and the punch,
and he&#8217;s game, too&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll have to hand him that.
But stacked up against the men who held the title
ten years ago he&#8217;d last about five rounds&ndash;&ndash;if he was
lucky. I don&#8217;t know why that is, either, unless he is
so crooked at heart that he loses confidence even in
himself when he has to face a real man. But the
public at this minute thinks he is as great as the
greatest. The way he polished off The Texan had
convinced them of that&ndash;&ndash;and we&ndash;&ndash;well, the paper always
tries to give them what they want, you know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that was the reason I ran up north last
week, after I&#8217;d got a tip that Conway hailed originally
from a little New England village back in the hills&ndash;&ndash;one
of those towns that are almost as up-to-date
today as they were fifty years ago. It looked like
a nice catchy little story, which I will, of course, admit
I could have faked just as well as not. But it
was the cartoons I wanted. You can&#8217;t really fake
them&ndash;&ndash;not after you&#8217;ve once known the real thing.
And as it happens I have known it, for I came from
a village up that way myself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And, then, I was curious, too. I&#8217;ve always had
a private opinion that if chance hadn&#8217;t pitchforked
Conway into the prize-ring he&#8217;d have made a grand
success as a blackjack artist or a second-story man.
But I wanted the pictures, and it wasn&#8217;t a very difficult
matter either to get them. You see I knew just
where I&#8217;d find what I wanted, and things panned out
pretty much as I thought they would.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t take more than a half hour to spread the
report that Conway was practically the only really
famous man in the country today, and in a fair way
to make his own home town just as celebrated. It
may sound funny to you, for you don&#8217;t know the
back-country as I do, but just that short article in
the daily, coupled with a few helpful hints from me
that I was looking for all the nice, touching incidents
of his boyhood days, with the opinions of the oldest
inhabitants, and maybe a few of their pictures to be
used in a big Sunday feature, brought them all out:
the old circle of regulars which always sits around
the tavern stove nights, straightening out the country&#8217;s
politics and attending strictly to everybody&#8217;s affairs
but their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eager? Man, it was a stampede! I reckon that
every male inhabitant within a radius of five miles
was there when I opened the meeting with a few
choice words&ndash;&ndash;every man but one, and he comes in
just a little later in this tale. They surely did turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
out. It was as perfect a mass meeting as any I&#8217;ve
ever seen, but the crowd itself didn&#8217;t get much of a
chance to talk&ndash;&ndash;not individually anyhow. They were
simply the chorus of &#8216;ayes&#8217; which the town&#8217;s big man
paused now and then for them to voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did the talking, Flash. They called him
&#8216;Judge&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;they most always do in those towns. He
most certainly monopolized the conversation, and
while he gave his monologue, I sat and got the best
of them down on paper. They thought I was taking
notes. I&#8217;ll show you his picture some day. He&#8217;s
the meanest man I ever met yet&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ve met a few!
Puffy-faced and red, and too close between the eyes.
Fat, too! Somehow I&#8217;m ashamed of being plump
myself, since meeting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did all the talking, and from the very first
time he opened his mouth I knew he was lying. You
can always tell a professional liar; he lies too smoothly,
somehow. Well, to judge from his story Conway
was the only unspotted cherub child that had
ever been born and bred in that section. Oh, yes, <i>he&#8217;d</i>
seen the promise in Conway; <i>he</i> knew that Conway
was to be the pride and joy of the community, right
from the first. <i>He&#8217;d</i> always said so! Why, <i>he</i> was
the very man who had given him his first pointers
in the game, when he was cleaning up all the rest of
the boys in town, just by way of recreation. If I&#8217;d
never had a suspicion before I&#8217;d have known just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
from those slick sentences of his that Conway had
never been anything in that village but a small-sized
edition of the full-blown crook he is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t have any reason to contradict him,
did I? He was doing all that I could ask, and more.
For there wasn&#8217;t a man in that whole crowd who
dared to sneeze until he got his cue from the Judge.
But that fat man got his jolt finally, just the same,
and got it good, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had just finished telling how Conway had
cleaned up the village kids, irrespective of size, whenever
he felt the need of exercise, and was looking
around at the circle behind him to give them a chance
to back him up, when it happened. I told you a minute
ago that I wished you could have seen that boy,
as I saw him that night, standing there in that tavern
doorway. You see, he&#8217;d come in so quietly that nobody
had heard him&ndash;&ndash;come in just in time to hear the
Judge&#8217;s last words. And when the Judge turned
around he looked full into that boy&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he got his, good and plenty! I didn&#8217;t watch
him very closely because it was hard for me to take
my eyes off the white face of that boy at the door.
But I did see that he went pretty nearly purple for
a minute, and I heard him gurgle, too, he was that
surprised, before he caught his breath. Then he
stuck out one hand and tried to bluff it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s one of &#8217;em, right now,&#8217; he sang out;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
but he should have known that a man who&#8217;s sure of
his ground doesn&#8217;t have to shout to make his point.
&#8216;There&#8217;s Young Denny Bolton,&#8217; he said, &#8216;who went
to school with him, right here in this town. <i>Ask him</i>
if Jeddy Conway was pretty handy as a boy!&#8217; And
he laughed, Flash&ndash;&ndash;commenced to chuckle! Oh,
there was no misunderstanding what he meant to
insinuate. &#8216;Ask him&ndash;&ndash;but maybe he&#8217;s still a little
mite too sensitive to talk about it yet&ndash;&ndash;eh, Denny?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought he could bluff it&ndash;&ndash;bluff me, with that
boy standing there in the doorway calling him a liar
as if I didn&#8217;t know it all, yet at that minute I
couldn&#8217;t help but ask that boy a question. I think
it was mostly because I wanted to hear what the
voice of a man with a face like his would sound like,
for he hadn&#8217;t opened his lips to answer that fat hypocrite&#8217;s
insinuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I asked him if he had known Conway well&ndash;&ndash;asked
him if he had had a few set-to&#8217;s with him
himself. I&#8217;m not going to forget how he looked
when he turned toward me, either. I&#8217;m not going
to forget the look on his face as he swung around.
And I&#8217;m remembering his voice pretty fairly well,
too, right now!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Maybe,&#8217; he answered me, and he almost drawled
the words. &#8216;Maybe I did,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Flash, he couldn&#8217;t have said more if he
had talked for a week. He&#8217;d said all there was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
say, now, hadn&#8217;t he? But it let the Judge out, just
the same, for he just gave the circle behind him the
the high sign and set the crowd to laughing for a
minute or two, until the tension was relieved. I
didn&#8217;t laugh myself. There didn&#8217;t seem to be much
of a joke about it after seeing that boy&#8217;s eyes. It
was Bolton&ndash;&ndash;Young Denny, they called him&ndash;&ndash;and I
got his story, their side of it at least, after he shut
the door behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s another thing I&#8217;d be more likely to understand
than you would, Flash, because you&#8217;ve never
lived in a village like that, and I have. Back a hundred
years or so the first settlement had been named
for his family&ndash;&ndash;Boltonwood, they&#8217;d called it&ndash;&ndash;but I
guess the strain must have petered out. From all I
could gather the Boltons had been drinking themselves
to death with unfailing regularity and dispatch
for several generations back, and I heard a choice
detailed description, too, of the way the boy&#8217;s own
father had made his final exit&ndash;&ndash;heard it from that
moon-faced leading citizen who did all the talking&ndash;&ndash;that
made me want to kick him in the face. I don&#8217;t
know yet why I didn&#8217;t. I was sitting on the tavern
desk with my feet on a level with his face. I should
have bashed him a good one. It&#8217;s one of the lost opportunities
which I&#8217;ll always regret, unless maybe I
take a Saturday off some day and run up and beat
him up proper!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He gave me a nice little account of how the boy&#8217;s
dad had gone over, screaming mad, with the town&#8217;s
elite standing around saying, &#8216;I told you so,&#8217; and that
big scared kid kneeling beside his bed, trying to pray&ndash;&ndash;trying
to make it easier for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see a flock of buzzards circling,
Flash, waiting for some wounded thing beneath them
to die? No? Well, I have, and it isn&#8217;t a pretty
sight either. That was what they made me think of
that night. And I learned, too, how they&#8217;d been
waiting ever since for that boy to go the way his
father had traveled before him; they even told me
that the same old jug still stood in the kitchen corner,
and would have pointed out his tumble-down old
place on the hill, where they had let him go on living
alone, only it was too dark for any one to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd, now wasn&#8217;t it? But it didn&#8217;t come to me
at that moment. I never gave it a thought that there
was a man who had licked Conway once and might
do it again. But I didn&#8217;t forget him; I wanted to,
that night, but I couldn&#8217;t. And I guess I was still
thinking about him when some one touched my arm
the next morning, while I was waiting for the train,
and I turned around and found him standing there
beside me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flash, have you noticed how grave he is&ndash;&ndash;kind of
sober-quiet? Have you? That comes from living
too much alone. And he&#8217;s only a kid, after all&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
all, just a kid. He startled me for a moment,
but the minute I looked at him that morning I knew
he had something on his mind, and after I&#8217;d tried
to make it a little easier for him I gave him a chance
to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a big raw welt across one cheek&ndash;&ndash;a wicked
thing to look at! You&#8217;ve noticed it, I see. Well, he
stood there fingering it a little, trying to think of a
way to begin gracefully. Then he got out the paper
with the account of Jed The Red&#8217;s last go in it and
jumped right into the middle of all that was bothering
him. He hunted out the statement of Conway&#8217;s
share of the purse and asked me if it was true. I
told him it was&ndash;&ndash;that I&#8217;d written it myself. And
then he asked me, point blank, how <i>he</i> could get a
chance at Conway. He&ndash;&ndash;he said Conway had never
been able to whip him, Flash&ndash;&ndash;said he didn&#8217;t believe
he ever could!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m sentimental&ndash;&ndash;I know that. But I manage
to keep my feet on the ground now and then just
the same. And so I want to say right here that it
wasn&#8217;t his words that counted with me. Why, I&#8217;d
have laughed in his face only for the way he said
them! As it was, I said too much. But I thought
of you then&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t help it, could I? It hit me
smash between the eyes! His face had been reminding
me of something&ndash;&ndash;something I couldn&#8217;t place until
that minute. Flash, do you know what he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
me think of? Do you? Well, he looked like a halftone
print of the Pilgrim Fathers&ndash;&ndash;the kind that they
hang on the walls in the district schools. And it got
me&ndash;&ndash;got me!&ndash;&ndash;maybe you know why. I don&#8217;t. But
I wrote it on this card, under your address, and gave
it to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have laughed at him only he was so mighty
grave and quiet. One doesn&#8217;t make a practice of
laughing at men who are as big as he is&ndash;&ndash;not when
they carry themselves like that. I kept my funny
feelings to myself, if I had any, while I spent a minute
or two sizing him up. And that brought me back
to his chin&ndash;&ndash;back to that big, oozing cut. I had been
waiting for an opportunity to ask him about it, and
didn&#8217;t know myself how to go about it. Just from that
you can realize how he had me guessing, for it takes
quite some jolt to make me coy. So I followed his
own lead finally and blurted the question right out,
without any fancy conversational trimmings, and he
told me how it had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of his horses had kicked him. You look as
though you could have guessed it yourself! He didn&#8217;t
tell you, did he, Flash? No-o-o? Well, that was it.
He said he had gone blundering in on them the
night before, to feed, without speaking to them in the
darkness. It isn&#8217;t hard to guess what had made him
absent-minded that night. You can&#8217;t know, just from
seeing it now, how bad that fresh cut was, either. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
looked bad enough to lay any man out, and I told
him so. But he said he had managed to feed his
horses just the same&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d worked them pretty hard
that week in the timber!</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t merely what he said, you see; it was
the way he said it. I&#8217;ve made more fuss before now
over pounding my finger with a tack hammer. And I
did a lot of talking myself in that next minute or
two. A man can say a whole lot that is almost worth
while when he talks strictly to himself. It wasn&#8217;t
alone the fact that he had been able to get back on
his feet and keep on traveling after a blow that would
have caved in most men&#8217;s skulls that hit me so hard.
The recollection of what his eyes had been like that
night before, when he had handed the Judge the lie
without even opening his lips, helped too&ndash;&ndash;and the
way he shut his mouth, there on the station platform,
when I gave him an opening to say his little say concerning
the village in general. He just smiled, Flash,
a slow sort of a smile, and never said a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, he knew how to take punishment! Oh,
don&#8217;t doubt that! I realized right then that he had
been taking it for years, ever since they had
counted his father out, with the whole house yelling
for the stuff to get him, too. He&#8217;d been hanging on,
hoping for a fluke to save him. He&#8217;d been hanging
on, and he didn&#8217;t squeal, either, while he was doing
it. Not&ndash;&ndash;one&ndash;&ndash;yip&ndash;&ndash;out&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;him!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So I made him give me back the card and I wrote
the rest of this stuff across the back of it. And again
I&#8217;ll tell you, Flash, right now, I&#8217;m not sure why I
did it. But I&#8217;ll tell you, too, just as I told myself a
few mornings ago, back there on that village station
platform, that if I were Jed The Red and I had my
choice, I wouldn&#8217;t choose to go up against a man who
had been waiting five years for an opening to swing.
No&ndash;&ndash;I would not! For he&#8217;s quite likely to do more
or less damage. I never thought he&#8217;d turn up, and I
don&#8217;t know whether I am sorry or not. But now
that he&#8217;s here, what are you going to do about it?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault, but whatever you do I want to ask
you not to do one thing. I want you to promise not
to try to make a fool of the boy, Flash? You&#8217;re,
well&ndash;&ndash;a little bit merciless on some of &#8217;em, you know.
It&#8217;s not his fault, and I&ndash;&ndash;why, damn it, I haven&#8217;t met
a man in years I like as I do that big, quiet, lonesome
kid! Now, there&#8217;s your story. It explains the whole
thing, and my apologies go with it. What are you
going to do?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>Jesse Hogarty had been listening without
moving a muscle&ndash;&ndash;without once taking his two
brilliant eyes from Morehouse&#8217;s warm face&ndash;&ndash;even
when Morehouse refused to look back at him
as he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Introducing The Pilgrim,&#8217;&#8221; he murmured to
himself, after a moment of silence, and the professor
of English accent could not have been more perfect,
&#8220;The Pilgrim! Hum-m-m, surely! And a really
excellent name for publicity purposes, too. It&ndash;&ndash;it
fits the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he threw back his head&ndash;&ndash;he came suddenly
to his feet, to pace twice the length of the room and
back, before he remembered. When he reseated himself
he was gnawing his lip as if vexed that he had
showed even that much lack of self-control. And
once more he buried the point of his chin in his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, Chub?&#8221; he picked up the other&#8217;s question
silkily. &#8220;What am I going to do? Well, I believe
I am going to pay my debts at last. I think I am
going to settle a little score that has stood so long
against me that it had nearly cost me my self-respect.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>That lightning-like change swept his face again,
twisting his lips nastily, stamping all his features with
something totally bad. The man who had never been
whipped by any man, from the day he won his first
brawl in the gutter, showed through the veneer that
was no thicker than the funereal black and white garb
he wore, no deeper than his superficially polished utterance
which he had acquired from long contact with
those who had been born to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to pay my debts,&#8221; he slurred the words
dangerously, &#8220;pay them with the same coin that Dennison
slipped to me two years ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>Little by little Morehouse&#8217;s head came forward at
the mention of that name. It was of Dennison that
the plump newspaper man had been subconsciously
thinking ever since he had entered Hogarty&#8217;s immaculate
little office; it was of Dennison that he always
thought whenever he saw that bad light kindling
in the ex-lightweight&#8217;s eyes. Dennison was the promoter
who had backed Jed The Red from the day
when the latter had fought his first fight.</p>
<p>And, &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;Flash, you
don&#8217;t mean that you think that boy can stop&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty&#8217;s thin voice bit in and cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Think? I don&#8217;t have
to think any more! I know!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a second he seemed to be pondering something;
then he threw up his head again. And his startlingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
sudden burst of laughter made Morehouse wince a
little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a fool of him, Chub?&#8221; he croaked.
&#8220;Be merciful with the boy! Man, you&#8217;re half an hour
late! I did my best. Oh, I&#8217;m bad&ndash;&ndash;I know just
how bad I can be, when I try. But he called me!
Yes, that&#8217;s what he did&ndash;&ndash;he as much as told me that
I wasn&#8217;t giving him a chance to get his cards on the
table. So I ran him up against Sutton. And I did
more than that. I told Boots to get him&ndash;&ndash;told him
to beat him to death&ndash;&ndash;and I meant it, too! And do
you know what happened? Could you guess? Well,
I&#8217;ll tell you and save you time.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went in and took enough punishment from
Boots in that first round to make any man stop and
think. He put up the worst exhibition I ever saw,
just because he was trying to fight the way Ogden
had coached him, instead of his own style. That was
the first round; but it didn&#8217;t take him very long to
see where he had been wrong. There wasn&#8217;t any second
round&ndash;&ndash;that is, not so that you could really
notice it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was waiting for the bell, and the gong just
seemed to pick him up and drop him in the middle
of the ring. And Sutton went to him&ndash;&ndash;and he caught
Boots coming in! Why, he just snapped his right
over and straightened him up, and then stepped in
and whipped across his left, and Boots went back into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
the ropes. He went back&ndash;&ndash;and he stayed back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly, almost gutturally, Hogarty sketched it all
out: Young Denny&#8217;s calm statement of his errand,
his own groundless burst of spleen, and the outcome
of the try-out which had sent him hurrying back to
Denny&#8217;s dressing-room with many questions on his
tongue&#8217;s tip and a living hope in his brain which he
hardly dared to nurse.</p>
<p>Hogarty even recalled and related the late delivery
of the card of introduction which Morehouse
was now nervously twisting into misshapen shreds
and, word for word, repeated the boy&#8217;s grave explanation
of his reason for that tardiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;He bothered you, did he?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well, he
had me guessing, too, right from the first word he
spoke. There was something about him that left
me wondering&ndash;&ndash;thinking a little. But I&#8217;m understanding
a whole lot better since you finished talking.
You&#8217;re right, too, Chub&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re all of that! Five
years is a long time to wait for a chance to swing.
I ought to know&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve waited half that long myself.
That was the way he started for Boots, that second
round. Oh, it was deadly&ndash;&ndash;it was mighty, mighty
wicked. And now, to top it all, it&#8217;s The Red for
whom he was looking, too. I wish it wasn&#8217;t so easy;
I sure do! It&#8217;s so simple I almost don&#8217;t enjoy it. Almost&ndash;&ndash;but
not quite!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he shot to his feet and began pacing up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
and down the room. Morehouse sat following him
to and fro with his eyes, trying to comprehend each
step of this bewildering development which was furthest
of all from what he had expected. He had
listened with his face fairly glowing with appreciation
to the ex-lightweight&#8217;s account of Denny&#8217;s coming.
It was all so entirely in keeping with what he
had already known of him. But the glint died out
of his eyes after a time; even his nervously active
fingers stopped worrying the bit of cardboard on the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted that he could turn the trick, Flash,&#8221; he
suggested at last, &#8220;even admitting that he might be
able to stop Conway after a few months of training
to help him out, do you suppose he&#8217;d be willing to
hang around and fight his way up through the ranks,
until he forced &#8217;em to let him have his match? It&#8217;s
usually a two year&#8217;s job, you know, at the very
least.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why, Flash, but somehow the more
I think of it, the surer I grow that there is something
more behind his wanting that fight than we
know anything about. It isn&#8217;t just a grudge; it isn&#8217;t
just because of the dirty deal which that village has
been giving him, either. I&#8217;ve been wondering&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
wondering right now why he asked me if that account
of the purse was true or not. Because men
don&#8217;t fight the way you say he fought, Flash, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
for money. They fight hard, I&#8217;ll admit, but not that
way!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a living menace in Hogarty&#8217;s steady
tread up and down the room. He wheeled and
crossed, turned and retraced his steps noiselessly, cat-footed
in his low rubbed-shod shoes. And he turned
a gaze that was almost pitying upon the plump man&#8217;s
objection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years&ndash;&ndash;to get ready?&#8221; he asked softly.
&#8220;Chub, do you think I&#8217;d wait two years&ndash;&ndash;now? Why,
two months is too long, and that is the outside limit
which I&#8217;m allowing myself in this affair. You&#8217;re a little
slow, Chub&ndash;&ndash;just a bit slow in grasping the possibilities,
aren&#8217;t you? Think a minute! Put your
mind upon it, man! I&#8217;ve told you I am going to pay
Dennison off&ndash;&ndash;and pay him with the same coin that
he handed me. Doesn&#8217;t that mean anything at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped short, crossed to the table and stood
with his fingertips bracketed upon its surface. Morehouse
knew Hogarty&ndash;&ndash;knew him as did few other
men, unless, perhaps, it was those who, years before,
had faced him in the ring. And at that moment Hogarty&#8217;s
eyes were mere slits in his face as he stood and
peered down into the newspaper man&#8217;s upturned features,
his mouth like nothing so much as a livid scar
above his chin. There was nothing of mirth in those
eyes, nothing of merriment in that tight mouth, and
yet as he sat and gazed back up at them, Morehouse&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
own lips began to twitch. They began to relax. That
wide grin spread to the very corners of his eyelids
and half hid his delighted comprehension behind a
thousand tiny wrinkles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he breathed, &#8220;I wonder now, Flash,
if you are thinking about the same thing I am? For
if you are&ndash;&ndash;well, you&#8217;re too sober faced. You are
that! It&#8217;s time to indulge in a little hysterics.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he began to chuckle; he sat and shook with
muffled spasms of absolute joy as the thing became
more and more vivid with each new thought. Even
Hogarty&#8217;s answering smile, coming from reluctant
lips, had in it something of sympathetic mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I am thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just
that! It&#8217;s what I meant when I said I was going to
pay him&ndash;&ndash;with his own coin. When a man plays another
man crooked, he expects that other man to
come back at him some day; he is looking for him
to do that. But there is one thing he doesn&#8217;t expect&ndash;&ndash;not
usually. He isn&#8217;t looking for him to work the
same old game. It is something new he&#8217;s looking to
guard against.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is where Dennison is weak&ndash;&ndash;in that spot
and one other. He doesn&#8217;t know even yet that when I
fell for his game I fell hard enough to wake me up.
He thinks I haven&#8217;t a suspicion but what it was just
an accident that laid Sutton out, two years back&ndash;&ndash;just
a lucky punch of The Red&#8217;s that went across and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
spoiled our perfect frame-up. And he hasn&#8217;t a suspicion
that I know he was sure The Red was going
to clean up Sutton, just as surely as they went to the
ring together.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is where he is weak. When a man is a crook
he wants to be a real crook&ndash;&ndash;and a real one is suspicious
of everybody, even of himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted one hand and pounded gently upon the
polished surface of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old days are done&ndash;&ndash;dead&ndash;&ndash;when a man got
his reputation, and a chance at the big ones simply
by fighting his way up from the bottom. I can give
a man a bigger reputation in a week, with five thousand
dollars&#8217; worth of real advertising, than he&#8217;d be
able to get in a lifetime the old way. And training?&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked his head over one shoulder toward the
dressing-rooms beyond the closed door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now he is just where I want him. Why,
he looks like a pitiful dub if you hold him back. Order
him to wait&ndash;&ndash;and it&#8217;s heart-breaking to watch him
suffer. In one month I can teach him all he&#8217;ll ever
need to know about blocking and getting away. And
the rest? Well, you&#8217;ll get a chance to see just what
happens when he really goes into action. I tell you
it makes you stop and think.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t care what <i>he</i> is fighting for; I don&#8217;t
care what he wants. Pleasure or profit, it&#8217;s all one to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
me. It&#8217;s you I need most right now, Chub. I know
you have always been a little particular about soiling
your hands. A shady deal never appealed to me
so much, either, but I&#8217;m not exactly bashful about
this one. That part of it will be my own private
affair. You handle the publicity end&ndash;&ndash;merely hail
Bolton as a comer, when the time is ripe. Are you&ndash;&ndash;are
you in on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Morehouse thoughtfully scratched his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a trifle fastidious, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221; he
murmured, and unconsciously he mimicked Hogarty&#8217;s
measured accents. &#8220;But I hardly believe that any
sensitive scruples of mine would annoy me much in
this matter. I don&#8217;t know but what I&#8217;d just as soon
squash a snake with a brick, even if I knew it was
somebody&#8217;s beloved performing pet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, as you say, is your side of the question.
As for me&ndash;&ndash;well, every time I remember that popeyed
unctuous fat party they called the &#8216;Judge&#8217; chanting
Conway&#8217;s innocent childhood, with that big, lonesome
kid standing there in the doorway listening and
trying to understand, I begin to sizzle. It is time
that Conway was licked&ndash;&ndash;and licked right!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in on it&ndash;&ndash;I want to be there! But,&#8221; he
stopped and made a painstaking effort to fit the torn
card together again, &#8220;but I have an idea that Bolton
may be the one to hold out. There are some honest
people, you know, who are honest all the time. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
might not understand the necessity of&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;a little
professional fixing, so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he have to be in on it?&#8221; Hogarty countered
instantly. &#8220;Will he? Not to any great extent, he
won&#8217;t. According to my plan he fights straight. Don&#8217;t
you suppose I know a straight man when I see one,
just as well as you do?</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the whole thing&ndash;&ndash;just as I&#8217;ll put it up to
Dennison before it&#8217;s dark tonight. It&#8217;s Dennison&#8217;s
own plan, too, in the first place, so he hasn&#8217;t any kick
coming. We&#8217;ll match Bolton against one of the fairly
good ones&ndash;&ndash;Lancing, say&ndash;&ndash;in about two weeks.
Lancing gets his orders to open up in the sixth round
and go down with the punch&ndash;&ndash;and stay down! That&#8217;s
plain enough, isn&#8217;t it? Well, Bolton is fighting under
the name of &#8216;The Pilgrim,&#8217; and you step up the next
morning and give him two columns&ndash;&ndash;you hail him as
a real one, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll match him with The Texan then. Conway
whipped him back a week or two, but he had his hands
full doing it. The Texan&ndash;&ndash;and I ought to know&ndash;&ndash;is
open to reason if the figure is big enough to be persuasive.
We&#8217;ll see to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gets his orders, too&ndash;&ndash;just as if they were really
necessary! About the twelfth he lies down to sleep.
Why, it&#8217;s so simple it&#8217;s real art! I&#8217;ll just hold Bolton
back until those rounds. I&#8217;ll make him take it
slow&ndash;&ndash;and then send him in to clean up! Dennison
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
is shy a match right this minute for The Red; they&#8217;re
all a little doubtful about him. The Pilgrim will be
the only logical man in the world to send against him&ndash;&ndash;that
is, according to your sporting columns. And
Dennison, of course, being on the inside, knows he is
really nothing but a dub&ndash;&ndash;knows it is simply a plain
open and shut proposition. That is to say&ndash;&ndash;he <i>thinks</i>
he knows!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesse Hogarty paused and the corners of his lips
twitched back to show his teeth, but not in laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same little frame-up that he sent against
Boots and me,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;He ought to be satisfied,
hadn&#8217;t he? And I&#8217;ll have him on the street the
next morning&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll put him where he&#8217;ll be glad to
borrow a dollar to buy his breakfast with!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time they stared back into each other&#8217;s
face: Hogarty taut at the table side, Morehouse
slouched deep in his chair. The latter was the first
to break that pregnant silence. He was nodding his
head in thoughtful finality when he lifted himself to
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got me
snared! Not that I give two hoots about what happens
to Dennison, mind! I don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;although I must
admit that the prospect of his starving to death is a
lovely one to contemplate. And I&#8217;d die happy, I
think, if I could see The Red trimmed, and trimmed
with conscientious thoroughness. But those aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
my reasons for going hands with you in this assassination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know a hunch when I see one. I ought to, for
I&#8217;ve spent the contents of my little yellow envelope
often enough trying to make one come true. And
I&#8217;m in with you, Flash, till the returns are all in from
the last district, but it&#8217;s because I know that there is
something more than either of us dream of behind
that boy&#8217;s wanting to meet Conway. He has something
on his mind; he wants something, and wants it
real bad. And I like him&ndash;&ndash;I liked him right from
the beginning&ndash;&ndash;so I&#8217;ll stick around and help. Maybe
I&#8217;ll find out what it is that&#8217;s been bothering him, too,
before I get through. But I wish I wasn&#8217;t of such
an inquiring turn of mind. It keeps one too stirred
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped to grin comically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any objection, now that I&#8217;ve sworn allegiance,
Flash, if I go out and present myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty&#8217;s whole tense body began to relax, his
lean face softened and his eyes lost much of their
hardness and glitter as he shook his head in negation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little detail of the campaign which I had
already assigned to you,&#8221; he replied, and the inflection
of his voice was perfect. &#8220;Not that I have any fears
of his going the way of his forefathers, however, because
I haven&#8217;t. And if my assurance on that point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
perplexes you, you might ask him to have one drink
and watch his eyes when he refuses you.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would like to have you look out for him
for a while. If you don&#8217;t Ogden will&ndash;&ndash;Ogden likes
him, too&ndash;&ndash;and he is too frivolous to be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hogarty reached out one long arm and dropped a
hand heavily upon Morehouse&#8217;s shoulder. He was
smiling openly now&ndash;&ndash;smiling with a barefaced enjoyment
which the plump newspaper man had never before
known him to exhibit. And he continued to
smile, while he stood there in the open door and
watched Morehouse mince on tiptoe across the polished
floor to the corner where Ogden was officiously
presenting each member of the Monday morning
squad of regulars, as they returned from the dressing-rooms,
to the big-shouldered boy in black, whose face
was so very grave.</p>
<p>Hogarty smiled as he closed his office door, after
he had seen Morehouse slip his hand through the
crook of Young Denny&#8217;s arm, in spite of Bobby Ogden&#8217;s
yelp of protest, and clear a way to the outer entrance
with one haughty flip of his free hand.</p>
<p>Hours later that same day, when the tumult in
the long main room of the gymnasium had hushed
and the apathetic Legs and his helper had turned
again to their endless task of grooming the waxed
floor, Dennison, the manager of Jed The Red, sitting
in that same chair which Morehouse had occupied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
cuddling one knee in his hands, fairly basked in that
same smile. The purring perfection of Hogarty&#8217;s
discourse was enticing. The absurd simplicity of
his plan, which he admitted must, after all, be credited
to the astuteness of Dennison himself, was more
than alluring. But that smile was the quintessence
of hypnotic flattery.</p>
<p>It savored of a delightful intimacy which Jesse
Hogarty accorded to few men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>In all that hill town&#8217;s history no period had
ever before been so filled with sensation as
was that one which opened with the flight of
Judge Maynard&#8217;s yellow-wheeled buckboard along
the main street of Boltonwood to herald the passing
of the last of the line of men who had given the
village its name.</p>
<p>One by one, in bewildering succession, climax after
climax had piled itself upon those which already had
left the white-haired circle of regulars about the
Tavern stove breathless with fruitless argument and
footless conjecture.</p>
<p>Old Jerry&#8217;s desertion from the ranks of the old
guard over which the Judge had ruled with a more
than despotic tongue, bursting with bomblike suddenness
in their midst that very same night which
had seen Young Denny&#8217;s dramatic departure, had
complicated matters to an inconceivable degree. For,
after all, he was the one member of the circle to
whom they had all been unconsciously looking for
a comprehensive answer to the question which the
Judge&#8217;s crafty exhibition of the boy&#8217;s bruised face
had created.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>He enjoyed what none of the others could claim
an absolutely incontestable excuse for visiting the
old, weatherbeaten farmhouse on the hill above town&ndash;&ndash;and
in his official capacity they felt, too, that he
might venture a few tentative inquiries at least,
which, coming from any one else, might have savored
of indelicacy.</p>
<p>Not but what the circle had enjoyed Judge Maynard&#8217;s
masterly recital, for it had held them as one
man. But they were hungry also for facts&ndash;&ndash;facts
which could convince as well as entertain. Even the
Judge himself had planned upon Old Jerry&#8217;s co-operation;
he had had it in mind to be patronizingly
lenient that night; that is, after that first rebuke
which was to leave him the undisputed master of
the situation.</p>
<p>To reach the really great heights of which the
evening&#8217;s triumph was capable the old mail carrier&#8217;s
collaboration had been almost indispensable. They
had been waiting with hungry impatience for him.
And then Old Jerry had appeared&ndash;&ndash;he made his
entrance and his exit&ndash;&ndash;and departing had left them
gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Old Jerry had not waited to view the effect of
his mad defiance of the town&#8217;s great man. It is
doubtful if he had given that side of the issue one
passing thought, but his triumphant withdrawal from
the field had robbed the situation of not one bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
its decisiveness. Quiet followed his going, a stillness
so profound that they heard him cackling to himself
in insane glee as he went down the steps. And
that hush had endured while they waited in a delicious
state of tingling suspense for the first furious
sentences which should preface his lifelong banishment
from the circle itself.</p>
<p>For years they had whispered, &#8220;Just wait, he&#8217;ll
come to it&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll go just like the rest.&#8221; And so
Young Denny&#8217;s final weakening had not been so unexpected
as it might have been. And more than
once, too, when the Judge&#8217;s harsh censure of him
who had always been his stanchest supporter had
left Old Jerry cringing in his place beside the
stove, they had all felt the justice if not a premonition
of final retribution to come. It was the debonaire
dare-deviltry of Old Jerry&#8217;s defiance rather
than its unexpectedness which had proved its greatest
sensation. That day&#8217;s one supreme moment&ndash;&ndash;the
only one which had not suffered from too
acute anticipation&ndash;&ndash;came while they waited for
the Judge&#8217;s denial, that denial which was never
spoken.</p>
<p>The town&#8217;s great man had slumped back in his
chair in a kind of stunned trance while the apoplectic
purple of his earlier wrath faded from his face.
He did open his mouth, but not in any effort to
speak. It was only to lick his thick lips and gurgle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
noisily in his fat throat. He tried to rise, too, and
failed in his first attempt&ndash;&ndash;and tried again.</p>
<p>They had all realized what it was that made his
knees wabble as he crossed to the door; they understood
what had drained his face of all its color.
Every man of them knew why the latch rattled under
his shaking figure. The Judge had been afraid, not
merely morally frightened, but abjectly, utterly terrified
in the flesh&ndash;&ndash;afraid of the threat in the insolent
bearing of the little, shriveled man who had
passed out into the night a moment before.</p>
<p>It could have been funny. It might have been
sublimest farce-comedy, had they not lacked the
perspective necessary for its appreciation. But it
was enough that they realized that the demagogue
had come crashing down&ndash;&ndash;enough that, watching his
furtive disappearance that night, they learned how
pitiful a coward a blusterer really can be.</p>
<p>Old Jerry&#8217;s own actions in those days which followed
had furnished rich food for conjecture. The
fact that it had been the little mail-carrier himself
who had ridden in the carriage beside the slim girl
with the tumbled hair, at the head of the dreary
procession that toiled slowly up to the bleak cemetery
behind the church, had, indeed, been worthy
of some discussion. The spendthrift prodigality of
the white roses which rumor whispered he had gone
to place the next day over the new mound of raw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
earth had not gone unspoken. Even the resemblance
of the girl who John Anderson had named Dryad
in his hunger for the beautiful&ndash;&ndash;even the likeness
of her face with its straight little nose and wistfully
curved lips, to the features of that small, rain-stained
statue of the white and gold slip of a woman who
had been his wife, came in for its share of the discussion,
too.</p>
<p>But all those topics which were touched upon in
the nights that followed were, at best, of only secondary
importance. Inevitably the circle about the
stove swung back to a consideration of that first
day&#8217;s major climax, until the very discord of opinion
which hitherto had been the chief joy of those nightly
sessions bade fair to prove their total disruption.</p>
<p>For the circle of regulars were leaderless now;
there was no longer a master mind to hold in check
the flood of argument and rebuttal, or preserve a
unity of disagreement. Where before they had been
accustomed to take up each new development and
pursue it until it reached a state either too lucid for
further consideration or an insolvable problem that
dead-locked conversation, a half dozen different
arguments sprang up each night, splitting the circle
into wrangling factions which trebled the din of
voices and multiplied ten-fold the new note of bitter
personalities which had taken the place of former
incontrovertible logic.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Judge Maynard&#8217;s iron discipline was gone, and the
old guard faced a quite probable dissolution in the
first week or two which followed his going. More
from habit than anything else they had waited that
next night for him to come and clear his throat pompously
and open the evening&#8217;s activities. And the
Judge failed to appear, failed just as signally as had
Old Jerry.</p>
<p>And yet it was not the absence of the former which
had left them leaderless. Not one of them had realized
it the night before&ndash;&ndash;but that second night they
knew!</p>
<p>By his very rebellion Old Jerry had won the thing
which years of faithful service had failed to bring.
He had dethroned the despot, and the honors were
his by right of conquest.</p>
<p>The circle knew that the Judge would never return;
after one hour of fruitless waiting that was
a certainty. But night after night they continued to
gather, stubbornly, persistently hopeful that Old
Jerry would come back. And in the meantime they
almost forgot, at times, Young Denny who had gone
the way of his fathers as they had so truly prophesied;
they only touched a little uncomfortably upon
the problem of the slim, yellow-haired girl alone in
the battered cottage at the edge of the town, while
they reviewed with startlingly fertile detail and a
lingering relish that came very close to being hero-worship,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
his last brief remarks which had left the
Judge a wreck of his former magnificence.</p>
<p>If Old Jerry realized all this that had come to
pass he gave no outward sign of such knowledge.
He even forgot to pause impressively upon the top
step of the post-office those days, as he always had
formerly, before he made his straight-backed descent
with the pouches slung over one shoulder. There
were mornings when he came perilously near to ignoring
altogether the double line which, with a new deference,
greeted his daily passage to the waiting buggy,
and yet there was not one who dared so much as to
whisper that there was anything in his air of preoccupation
that savored of studiously planned forethought.
But it is doubtful if he did realize the
change that had taken place, at least in that first
week or two, for Old Jerry had much of a strictly
private nature to occupy his mind.</p>
<p>He was never quite able to remember the things
he had said that morning to the girl with the too-white
face and tumbled hair, huddled in the half-light
at the table before the window, or to recall
in any sort of a connected, coherent sequence his own
actions in those first few days which followed it.</p>
<p>It aggravated him for a day or two, this inability
to piece out the details; it brought a peevish frown
to his thin face and a higher, even more querulous
note to his shrill falsetto voice, which, while they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
hardly understood it, nevertheless resulted in an even
profounder hush in those respectful ranks. He
couldn&#8217;t even revisualize it clearly enough for his
own private edification&ndash;&ndash;for the joy of seeing himself
as others had seen him.</p>
<p>Nothing remained but a picture of Dryad Anderson&#8217;s
face&ndash;&ndash;the face that had tried so hard to smile&ndash;&ndash;which
she had lifted to him that first morning
when he entered the front room of the little drab
cottage at the edge of town. That was limned upon
his brain in startlingly perfect detail still&ndash;&ndash;that and
one other thing. The memory of John Anderson&#8217;s
pitifully wasted form huddled slack upon the high
stool, arms outstretched and silvered head bowed in
a posture of utter weariness, remained with him, too,
clinging in spite of every effort to dislodge it.</p>
<p>That whole week had not served to wipe it out.
Day after day, as Old Jerry drove his route with the
reins taut in his nervous hands, it floated up before
him. And even when he wound the lines about the
whipstock, letting the old mare take her own pace,
and leaned back, eyes closed, against the worn cushions,
the interior of that back-room shop with its
simple, terribly inert occupant and countless rows of
tiny white statues, all so white and strangely alike,
crept in under the lids.</p>
<p>Old Jerry&#8217;s mail route suffered that week; his original
&#8220;system&#8221; of mail distribution, of which he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
always been so jealously proud, went from bad to
very, very bad, and from that to an impossible worse;
and yet, while it became a veritable lottery for the
hillsfolk who were dependent upon him whether they
would receive the packet of mail which really belonged
to a two-mile distant neighbor or none at all,
in one respect the rural service improved immensely,
and the improvement&ndash;&ndash;and strangely enough, too&ndash;&ndash;was
as directly a result of that stubborn image of
John Anderson&#8217;s bowed head which persisted in
haunting the mind of the servant of the Gov&#8217;mint as
was the alarming growth of his lack of dependability.</p>
<p>Day by day Old Jerry grew less and less prone to
let the leisurely white mare take her own pace. Instead,
he sat stiffly erect a great portion of the time,
driving with one eye cocked calculatingly upon the
course of the sun, and his mind running far ahead
of him, to the end of the day&#8217;s route, when he would
have to turn in at the cross-road that toiled up the
grade to the wind-racked old Bolton place on the hill
north of town.</p>
<p>They had always had a forbidding aspect&ndash;&ndash;Young
Denny&#8217;s black, unpainted farmhouse and dilapidated
outbuildings&ndash;&ndash;even when he had been certain that just
as surely as he reached the crest he would find the
boy&#8217;s big body silhouetted against the skyline, waiting
for him, they had not been any too prepossessing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Now they never served to awake in him anything
but actual dread and distrust.</p>
<p>Old Jerry laid it to the lonesomeness of the place&ndash;&ndash;to
the bleak blindness of the shaded windows and
the untenanted silence&ndash;&ndash;but he took good care that no
loitering on his part would be to blame for his arrival
at the house after dusk.</p>
<p>No one, not even he himself, knew how strong the
temptation was that week to make tentative advances
of peace to the members of the circle of Tavern
regulars, for the more he dwelt upon it the finer the
dramatic possibilities of the thing seemed. But he
had misread in the hushed respect of his former intimates
a chill and uncompromising disapproval, and
he had to fall back upon a one-sided conversation with
himself as the next best thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t brought up to believe in ghosts,&#8221; he
averred to himself more than once. &#8220;Ghosts naturally
is superstition&ndash;&ndash;and that ain&#8217;t accordin&#8217; to religion,
not any way you look at it. But allowing that there
could be ghosts&ndash;&ndash;just for the sake of argument allowing
that there is&ndash;&ndash;now what would there be to
hinder him from just kinda settlin&#8217; down up there, as
you might say? It&#8217;s nice and quiet, ain&#8217;t it? Sort
of out of the way&ndash;&ndash;and more or less comfortable,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that point in the mumbled monologue the white-haired
driver of the buggy usually paused for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
moment, tilting his head, birdlike, to one side,
wrapped in thought. There were those shelves lined
with countless white figures which also had to be considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must&#8217;ve worked mighty steady,&#8221; he told himself
time and again in a voice that was small with
awe. &#8220;He must hev almost enjoyed workin&#8217; at &#8217;em,
to hev finished so many! And he kept at it nearly all
the time, I reckon. And now, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m a-gettin&#8217;
at! Now I want to ask how do we know he&#8217;s a-goin&#8217;
to quit now&ndash;&ndash;how do we know that? We don&#8217;t know
it! And Godfrey &#8217;Lisha, what better place would
he want than that back kitchen up there? Ain&#8217;t there
a table right there by the window, all a-waitin&#8217; for
him&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Invariably he broke off there, to peer furtively at
the sun, before he whipped up his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git along!&#8221; he admonished her earnestly, then,
&#8220;Git along&ndash;&ndash;you! Nobody believes in ghosts&ndash;&ndash;leastwise,
I don&#8217;t. But they ain&#8217;t no sense nor reason in
just a-killin&#8217; time on the road, neither. And I ain&#8217;t
one to tempt Providence&ndash;&ndash;not to any great nor damagin&#8217;
extent, I ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet in spite of all the uneasiness which the
combination of the dark house and the persistent
image of the little, worn-out stone-cutter kept alive in
him, in so far as Young Denny&#8217;s team of horses was
concerned, and the scanty rest of the stock which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
boy had left in his care, Old Jerry kept strictly to the
letter of his agreement. At the most it meant no
more than a little readjustment of his daily schedule,
which he high-handedly rearranged to suit his better
convenience.</p>
<p>But all the rest which he had promised so fervidly
to carry out&ndash;&ndash;the message which he had meant to deliver
the very next morning after the boy&#8217;s departure
and the explanation of Young Denny&#8217;s bruised face,
even a diplomatic tender of the damp wad of bills
which Denny had pushed in his hand&ndash;&ndash;had somehow
been allowed to wait. For it had proved to be anything
but the admirably simple thing it had seemed
to the old man when he had volubly acquiesced to the
plan.</p>
<p>He had forgotten it that first morning. With the
well-planned opening sentence fairly trembling upon
his tongue-tip when he opened the door, the whole
thing had been swept utterly from his mind. And in
the press of events that followed he never so much
as thought of it again for days. When the memory
of it did return, a week later, somehow he found it
almost impossible to introduce the subject&ndash;&ndash;at least
impossible to introduce it gracefully.</p>
<p>That was one of the reasons for his failure to execute
the mission entrusted to him. The other reason,
which was far weightier, so far as Old Jerry was
concerned, was even harder to define. He blamed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
directly to the attitude of the girl with the tumbled
yellow hair and blue eyes, which were never quite
the same shade of purple. More than a small proportion
of the remarks which he had prepared beforehand
to deliver to her had consisted of reproof&ndash;&ndash;not
too harsh, but for all that a trifle severe, maybe&ndash;&ndash;of
her hasty and utterly unfair judgment of Young
Denny. That, he had assured himself, was only just
and merited, and could only prove, eventually, to
have been for the best. But she never gave him
a chance to deliver it. One moment of sadness on
her part would have been sufficient excuse. If he
could have surprised her just once gazing at him
from moist, questioning eyes, he felt that that would
have been enough proof of contrition and humble
meekness of spirit on her part. But he never
did.</p>
<p>Instead Old Jerry had never seen so astounding a
change take place in any human being as that which
came over her day by day. By the end of that first
week the pallor had gone entirely from her cheeks.
The deep dark circles which had rimmed the wet
eyes which she had lifted to him that first morning
disappeared so entirely that it was hard to remember
that they had ever been there at all. Even the lithely
slender body seemed fuller, rounder. To every outward
appearance at least Old Jerry had to confess
to himself that he had never seen a more supremely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
contented, thoroughly happy creature than Dryad
Anderson was at that week&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>And it irritated him; it almost angered him at
times. Remembering his own travail of spirit, the
self-inflicted agony of mind which he had undergone
that day when he had first looked square into the
eyes of his own soul and acknowledge his years of
guilty unfairness to the lonely boy on the hill, he shut
his lips tight upon the message he might have delivered
and waited, stubbornly, for her to show some
sign of repentance.</p>
<p>For a day or two a mental contemplation of this
necessarily severe course brought him moments of
comparative peace of mind. It justified in a measure,
at least, his own remissness, and yet even that
mind-state at times was rudely shaken. At each day&#8217;s
end, after he had made his reluctant ascent of the
hill which led up to Young Denny&#8217;s unlighted house,
and a far speedier, none too dignified return, the
little driver of the squealing buggy made it a point to
turn off and stop for a moment or two before the
gate of John Anderson&#8217;s cottage. At first the girl&#8217;s
real need of him prompted this daily detour; then,
when the actual need no longer existed, he excused
the visit on the plea of her lonesomeness and his
promise to Denny to look after her.</p>
<p>His own loneliness&ndash;&ndash;for he had never been so
lonely before in all his lonely life&ndash;&ndash;and the other and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
real reason for this habit, he never allowed himself
to scrutinize too closely. But each day he sat a little
forward on the buggy seat as soon as he had turned
the last sharp curve in the road and stared eagerly
ahead through the afternoon dusk until he made out
her slim figure leaning against the fence waiting for
him. And every afternoon, after he had pulled the
shuffling horse to a standstill, he bent down from
his vantage point on the high seat to scan her upturned
face minutely, almost craftily at times, for
some tell-tale trace of tears on her long lashes, or a
possible quiver of her lips, or a suspicious droop in
her boyish shoulders. And he never discovered either
the one or the other.</p>
<p>It was at such moments that his peace of mind
suffered, for no sane man could ever have read, by
any stretching of the imagination, anything akin to
sorrow or sadness in the low laugh with which she
invariably met his scrutiny. It fairly bubbled joy.
Each day Old Jerry found her only happy&ndash;&ndash;offensively
happy&ndash;&ndash;and where he had been secretly watching
her for one betraying sign he became uneasily
conscious after a time that very often she, too, seemed
to be scanning his own face as if she were trying to
penetrate into the inner tumult of perplexities behind
his seamed forehead. Some days he was almost certain
that there was a calculating light in her steady
eyes&ndash;&ndash;a hint of half-hidden delight in something he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
couldn&#8217;t understand&ndash;&ndash;and it worried him. It bothered
him almost as much as did the unvaried formula with
which she greeted him every afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any news for me today?&#8221; she always
asked him. &#8220;Surely you&#8217;ve something new to tell me
this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;now, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone in which she made the query was never
anything but disarming; it was quite childishly wheedling
and innocently eager, he thought. But reiterated
from day to day it wore on his nerves after a while.
Added to the something he sometimes thought he
caught glimmering in her tip-tilted eyes, it made him
more than a little uncomfortable. He fell back upon
a quibble to dodge the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was you expectin&#8217; a letter?&#8221; he always countered.</p>
<p>This daily veiled tilt of wits might have gone on
indefinitely had not a new development presented itself
which threw an entirely different aspect upon the
whole affair.</p>
<p>A fortnight had elapsed since Denny Bolton&#8217;s mysterious
departure from the village when it happened.
As usual, after the day&#8217;s duties were completed with
his hurried return from the Bolton homestead, Old
Jerry turned off at the crossroads to stop for a moment
before the cottage squatting in its acre of desolate
garden. He didn&#8217;t even straighten up in his seat
that afternoon to gaze ahead of him, so certain he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
had grown that she would be waiting for him, a hint
of laughter in her eyes and the same disturbing question
on her lips, and not until the fat animal between
the shafts had stopped of her own accord before the
straggling fence did he realize that the girl was not
there. Then her absence smote him full.</p>
<p>It frightened him. Right from the first he was
conscious of impending disaster born quite entirely
of the knowledge of his own guilt. The front door
of the house was open and after fruitless minutes of
panicky pondering he clambered down and advanced
uncertainly toward it. His shadow across the threshold
heralded his reluctant coming, and Dryad turned
from the half-filled box upon the table over which she
had been bending and nodded to him almost before
he caught sight of her.</p>
<p>That little, intimately brief inclination of the head
was her only greeting. With hands grasping each
side of the door-frame Old Jerry stood there and
gazed about the room. It had never been anything
but bare and empty looking&ndash;&ndash;now with the few larger
pieces of furniture which it had contained all stacked
in one corner and the smaller articles already stored
away in a half-dozen boxes, the last of which was
holding the girl&#8217;s absorbed attention, it would have
been barnlike had it not been so small. From where
he stood Old Jerry could see through into the smaller
back-room workshop. Even its shelves were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
empty,&ndash;&ndash;entirely stripped of their rows of tiny white woman-figures.</p>
<p>He paled as he grasped the ominous import of it;
he tried to speak unconcernedly, but his voice was
none too steady.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re a-house-cleanin&#8217;, be you?&#8221; he asked
jauntily. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you commencin&#8217; a little early?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was uncomfortably conscious of that interrogative
gleam in Dryad&#8217;s glance&ndash;&ndash;that amused glimmer
which he couldn&#8217;t quite fathom&ndash;&ndash;when she turned
her head. She was smiling, too, a little&ndash;&ndash;smiling with
her lips as well as with her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o-o,&#8221; she stated with preoccupied lack of emphasis,
as she bent again over the box. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
packing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry had known that that would be her answer.
He had been certain of it. The other interpretation&ndash;&ndash;the
only other possible one which could
be put upon the dismantled room&ndash;&ndash;had been nothing
more or less than a momentary and desperate grasping
at a straw.</p>
<p>For a while he was very, very quiet, wondering
just what it was in her mind which made her so cheerfully
indifferent to his presence. She filled that last
box while he stood there in the doorway, stood off
to survey her work critically, and then picked up a
hammer that lay on the table and prepared to nail
down the lid.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve hit my finger four times today,&#8221; she apprised
him between strokes as she drove the first nail home.
&#8220;Four times this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;and always the same
finger, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>The very irrelevancy of the statement, coupled with
her calm serenity, was appalling to the old man. She
didn&#8217;t so much as lift her eyes when she told him,
but when the lid was fastened she whirled suddenly
with that impetuosity which always startled him more
than a little, her hands tightly clasped in front of
her, and fairly beamed at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, that finishes everything&ndash;&ndash;everything but
the pots and pans,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll need them
a little longer, anyway, won&#8217;t I? But maybe I won&#8217;t
take them with me, either&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re pretty old and
worn out. What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry cleared his throat. He ignored her question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;ain&#8217;t this a trifle sudden,&#8221; he faltered&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;jest
a trifle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head again and laughed softly, as
if from sheer joyous excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve been planning it for
days and days&ndash;&ndash;oh, for more than a week!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she seemed to catch for the first time the
dreariness of his whole attitude&ndash;&ndash;the dejection of
his spare angular body and sparrowlike, anxious face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sorry I&#8217;m going,&#8221; she accused him then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
and she leaned toward him a little, eyes quizzically
half closed. &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d be sorry!&#8221; And then,
swiftly, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry scraped first one foot and then the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I be,&#8221; he admitted faintly. &#8220;Kinda surprised,
too. I&ndash;&ndash;I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t exactly calculating on anything
like this. It&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s kinda thrown me off my
reckonin&#8217;! Are you&ndash;&ndash;are you figurin&#8217; on goin&#8217; right
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dryad spun about and threw her head far on one
side to scan the whole bare room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, maybe,&#8221; she decided, when she
turned back to him. &#8220;Or the next day at the very
latest. You see, everything is about ready now, and
there isn&#8217;t any reason for me to stay, on and on,
here&ndash;&ndash;is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>A little tired note crept into the last words, edging
the question with a suggestion of wistfulness. It
was something not so very different from that for
which Old Jerry had been stubbornly waiting throughout
those entire two weeks, but he failed to catch
it at that moment. He had heard nothing but her
statement that she meant to remain at least another
day. It made it possible for him to breathe deeply
once again.</p>
<p>Much could happen in twenty-four hours. She
might even change her mind, he desperately assured
himself&ndash;&ndash;women were always doing something like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
that, wern&#8217;t they? But even if she did go it was
a reprieve; it gave him one last opportunity. Now,
for the present, all he wanted was to get away&ndash;&ndash;to
get away by himself and think! On heavily dragging
feet he turned to go back down the rotting
boardwalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll drop in on you tomorrow,&#8221; he suggested,
pausing at the steps. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stop in on my way &#8217;round&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;to
say good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl stood in the doorway smiling down at
him. He couldn&#8217;t meet her eyes. As it was he felt
that their gaze went through and through him. And
so he did not see her half lift her arms to him in a
sudden quite wonderful gesture of contrite and remorseful
reassurance. He did not hear the first
of the impulsive torrent of words which she barely
smothered behind lips that trembled a little. His
head was bowed so that he did not see her eyes, and
if he could but have seen them and nothing else, he
would have understood, without the words or the
gesture.</p>
<p>Instead he stood there, plucking undecidedly at
his sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&ndash;&ndash;I wouldn&#8217;t like to hev you go&ndash;&ndash;without
seein&#8217; you again,&#8221; he went on slowly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;without
a chance to tell you something&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;to tell you good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t wait for her answer. At the far bend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
in the road, when he looked back, she was still there
in the doorway watching him.</p>
<p>He was not quite certain, but he thought she threw
up one thin white arm to him as he passed out of
sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>It rained that next day&ndash;&ndash;a dull, steady downpour
that slanted in upon a warm, south wind. Old
Jerry was glad of the storm. The leaden grayness
of the low-hanging clouds matched perfectly his
own frame of mind, and the cold touch of the rain
soothed his hot head, too, as it swept in under the
buggy hood, and helped him to think a little better.
There was much that needed readjusting.</p>
<p>Throughout the early hours of that morning he
drove with a newspaper spread flat upon his knees&ndash;&ndash;the
afternoon edition of the previous day, which, in
the face of other matters, he had had neither the
necessary time nor enthusiasm to examine until it
was an entire twelve hours old. At any other time
the contents of that red-headlined sheet would have
set his pulses throbbing in a veritable ecstasy of
excitement.</p>
<p>For two whole weeks he had been watching for
it, scanning every inch of type for the news it brought,
but now that account of Young Denny&#8217;s first match,
with a little, square picture of him inset at the column
head, fell woefully flat so far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>Not that the plump newspaperman who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
written the account of that first victorious bout had
achieved anything but a masterpiece of sensationalism.
Every line was alive with action, every phrase
seemed to thud with the actual shock of contest. And
there was that last paragraph, too, which hailed
Denny&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;The Pilgrim,&#8221; they called him in the paper,
but that couldn&#8217;t deceive Old Jerry&ndash;&ndash;as the newcomer
for whom the public had been waiting so long,
and, toward the end, so hopelessly.</p>
<p>It was really a perfect thing of its kind&ndash;&ndash;but Old
Jerry could not enjoy it that morning, even though
it was Denny Bolton&#8217;s first triumph, to be shared
by him alone in equal proportion. Instead of sending
creepy thrills chasing up and down his spine it merely
intensified his doleful bitterness of spirit. Long before
noon he breathed a leaden heavy sigh, refolded
the sodden sheet and put it away in the box beneath
the seat.</p>
<p>The old mare took her own pace that day. In a
brain that was already burdened until it fairly ached
there was no room for the image of the silver-haired
stone-cutter which had made for speed on other occasions.
He had plenty to occupy his mind which
was of a strictly immediate nature.</p>
<p>A dozen times that morning Old Jerry asked himself
what he would tell Dryad Anderson that night,
when he stopped at the little drab cottage at the
route&#8217;s end, ostensibly to bid her good-by. He asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
himself, in desperate reiteration, <i>how</i> he would tell,
for he knew that the long delay in the delivery of
Denny&#8217;s message was going to need more than a little
explanation. And when he had wrestled with the
question until his eyes stung and his temples throbbed,
and still could find no solution for it, he turned helplessly
to the consideration of another phase of the
problem.</p>
<p>He fell to tormenting himself with the possibility
of her having gone already. Everything in those bare
rooms had been packed&ndash;&ndash;there was no real reason
for the girl to remain another hour. Perhaps she
had reconsidered, changed her mind, and departed
even earlier than she had planned, and if she had&ndash;&ndash;if
she had&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Whenever he reached that point, dumbly he bowed
his head.</p>
<p>It was dark when he turned off the main road and
started up the long hill toward the Bolton place&ndash;&ndash;not
just dark, but a blackness so profound that the
mare between the shafts was only a half formless
splotch of gray as she plodded along ahead. Even
his dread of the place, which formerly had been so
acute, did not penetrate the mental misery that
wrapped him; he did not vouchsafe so much as one
uneasy glance ahead until a glimmer of light which
seemed to flash out from the rear of the house fairly
shocked him into conscious recollection of it all.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>He sprang erect then, spilling a cataract of water
from his hat brim in a chill trickle down the back
of his neck, and barked a shrilly staccato command
at the placid horse. The creaking buggy came to a
standstill.</p>
<p>He tried to persuade himself it was a reflection
of the village lights upon the window panes which
had startled him, but it was only a half-hearted effort.
No one could mistake the glow that filtered out of
the black bulk of the rear of the house for anything
save the thing it was. Half way up the hill he sat
there, hunched forward in a hopeless huddle, his eyes
protected by cupped palms, and stared and stared.</p>
<p>Once before, the evening of that day when the
Judge&#8217;s exhibition of Young Denny&#8217;s bruised face had
been more than his curiosity could endure, he had
approached that bleak farmhouse in fear and trembling,
but the trepidation of that night, half real, half
a child of his own erratic imagination, bulked small
beside the throat-tightening terror of this moment.</p>
<p>And yet he did not turn back. The thought that
he had only to wheel his buggy and beat as silent a
retreat as his ungreased axles would permit never
occurred to him. It was much as if his harrowed
spirit, driven hither and yon without mercy throughout
the whole day long, had at last backed into a
corner, in a mood of last-ditch, crazy desperation, and
bared its teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If he is up there,&#8221; he stated doggedly, &#8220;if he
is up there, a-putterin&#8217; with his everlasting lump o&#8217;
clay, he ain&#8217;t got no more right up there than I hev!
He&#8217;s just a-trespassin&#8217;, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s a-doin&#8217;. I&#8217;m
the legal custodian of the place&ndash;&ndash;it was put into
my hands&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll tell him so. I&#8217;ll give him a
chance to git out&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;or I&#8217;ll hev the law on
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The plump mare went forward again. There was
something terribly uncanny, even in her relentless advance,
but the old man clung to the reins and let
her go without a word. When she reached the top
she slumped lazily to a standstill and fell contentedly
to nibbling grass.</p>
<p>The light in the window was much brighter, viewed
from that lessened distance&ndash;&ndash;thin, yellow streaks
of brightness that quivered a little from the edges
of a drawn shade. An uneven wick might easily have
accounted for the unsteadiness, but in that flickering
pallor Old Jerry found something ominously unhealthy&ndash;&ndash;almost
uncanny.</p>
<p>But he went on. He clambered down from his
high seat and went doggedly across&ndash;&ndash;steadily&ndash;&ndash;until
his hand found the door-latch. And he gave himself
no time for reconsideration or retreat. The metal
catch yielded all too readily under the pressure of
his fingers, and when the door swung in he followed
it over the threshold.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>The light blinded him for a moment&ndash;&ndash;dazzled him&ndash;&ndash;yet
not so completely but that he saw, too clearly
for any mistake, the figure that had turned from the
stove to greet him. Dryad Anderson&#8217;s face was pink-tinted
from forehead to chin by the heat of the glowing
lids&ndash;&ndash;her lips parted a little until the small teeth
showed white beyond their red fullness.</p>
<p>In her too-tight, boyish blouse, gaping at the throat,
she stood there in the middle of the room, hands
bracketed on delicate hips, and smiled at him. And
behind her the lamp in its socket on the wall smoked
a trifle from a too-high wick.</p>
<p>Old Jerry stood and gazed at her, one hand still
clutching the door latch. In one great illuminating
flash he saw it all&ndash;&ndash;understood just what it meant&ndash;&ndash;and
with that understanding a hot wave of rage
began to well up within him&ndash;&ndash;a fierce and righteous
wrath, borne of all that day&#8217;s unnecessary agony and
those last few minutes of fear.</p>
<p>It was a hoax on her part. She had been trifling
with him the day before, just as she had been playing
fast and loose with his peace of mind for days. An
ejaculation bordering close upon actual profanity
trembled upon his lips, but a draft of cold air sweeping
in at the open doorway set the lamp flickering
wildly and brought him back a little to himself. His
eyes went again to the girl in the middle of the floor.
She was rocking to and fro upon the balls of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
feet, every inch of her fairly pulsing with mocking,
malicious delight.</p>
<p>She waited for him to speak, and he, stiff of back
and grim of face, stood stonily silent. She seemed
all innocently unaware of his unconcealed disgust.
The quizzical smile only widened before the chilly
threat of his beady eyes and ruffled forehead. And
then, all in one breath, her little pouted chin went up
and she burst into a low gurgle of utter enjoyment
of the tableau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you ever going to
say anything? Here I am! I&ndash;&ndash;I decided to move
today&ndash;&ndash;there really wasn&#8217;t any use of waiting.
Aren&#8217;t you surprised&ndash;&ndash;just a little?&#8221;</p>
<p>The meekness of her voice, so wholly belied by
her eyes and lips and swaying boy-like body, only
tightened the old man&#8217;s mouth. He was still reviewing
all that long day&#8217;s mental torment, counting the
wasted hours which might have been applied to a
soul-satisfying feast upon Morehouse&#8217;s red-headlined
account in the paper. No veteran had ever marched
more hopelessly into a cannon&#8217;s mouth than he had
approached the door of that kitchen.</p>
<p>And yet a flood of thankfulness, the direct reflex
of his first impotent rage, threatened to sweep up
and drown the fires of his wrath. Already he wanted
to slump down into a chair and rest weary body and
wearier, relieved brain; he wanted a minute or two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
in which to realize that she was there&ndash;&ndash;that his unfulfilled
promise was still far from being actual catastrophe&ndash;&ndash;and
he would not let himself. Not yet!</p>
<p>She had been playing with him&ndash;&ndash;playing with him
cat-and-mouse fashion. The birdlike features which
had begun to relax hardened once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I be,&#8221; he answered her question with noncommittal
grimness. &#8220;Maybe I be&ndash;&ndash;and maybe I
ain&#8217;t!&#8221; And then, almost belligerently: &#8220;Your
lamp&#8217;s a-smokin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned and strained on tiptoe and lowered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would be,&#8221; she agreed, too gravely
for his complete comfort, when she had accomplished
the readjustment of the wick to her entire satisfaction.
&#8220;For, you know, you seemed a little worried
and&ndash;&ndash;well, not just happy, yesterday, when I told you
I was going to move I&ndash;&ndash;I felt sure you would be
glad to find that I hadn&#8217;t gone far!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry remembered at that moment and he
removed his soaked hat. He turned, too, and drew
up a chair. It gave him an opportunity to avoid
those moistly mirthful eyes for a moment. Seated
and comfortably tilted back against the wall he felt
less ill at ease&ndash;&ndash;felt better able to deal with the
situation as it should be dealt with.</p>
<p>For a moment her presence there had only confounded
him&ndash;&ndash;that was when the wave of righteous
wrath had swept him&ndash;&ndash;but at the worst he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
counted it nothing more than a too far-fetched bit of
fantastic mischief conceived to tantalize him.</p>
<p>Her last statement awakened in him a preposterously
impossible suspicion which, now that he had a
chance to glance about the room, was confirmed instantly&ndash;&ndash;absolutely.
It was astounding&ndash;&ndash;utterly unbelievable&ndash;&ndash;and
yet on all the walls, in every corner,
there were the indisputable evidences of her intention
to remain indefinitely&ndash;&ndash;permanently.</p>
<p>At least it gave him an opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; he began challengingly,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t mean to tell me that you&#8217;re a-figurin&#8217; on
stayin&#8217; here&ndash;&ndash;for good?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pursed her lips and nodded vigorously at him
until the loosened wisps of hair half hid her eyes. It
was quite as though she were pleased beyond belief
that he had got at the gist of it all so speedily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for good,&#8221; she explained ecstatically, &#8220;or,&#8221;
more slowly, &#8220;or at least for quite a while. You
see I like it here! It&#8217;s just like home already&ndash;&ndash;just
like I always imagined home would be when I really
had one, anyway. There&#8217;s so much room&ndash;&ndash;and it&#8217;s
warm, too. And then, the floors don&#8217;t squeak, either.
I don&#8217;t think I care for squeaky floors&ndash;&ndash;do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick widening of those almost purple eyes accompanied
the last question.</p>
<p>The little white-haired figure in the back-tilted chair
snorted. He tried to disguise it behind a belated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
cough, but it was quite palpably a snort of outraged
patience and dignity. She couldn&#8217;t fool him
any longer&ndash;&ndash;not even with that wide-eyed appealingly
infantile stare. He knew, without looking closer,
that there was a flare of mirth hidden within its
velvet duskiness. And there was only one way to
deal with such shallowness&ndash;&ndash;that was with firm and
unmistakable severity. He leaned forward and
pounded one meager knee for emphasis as Judge
Maynard had often done.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; he emphasized flatly, his thin
voice almost gloatingly triumphant. &#8220;Whatever put
it into your head I don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;but don&#8217;t you realize
what you&#8217;re a-doin&#8217;, comin&#8217; up here like this and
movin&#8217; in, high-handed, without speaking to nobody?
Well, you&#8217;ve made yourself liable to trespass&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
what you&#8217;ve done! Trespass and house-breaking,
too, I guess, without interviewin&#8217; me first!&#8221;</p>
<p>The violet eyes flew wider. Old Jerry was certain
that he caught a gleam of apprehension in them.
She took one faltering step toward him and then
stopped, irresolute, apparently. Somehow the mute
appeal in that whole poise was too much, even for
his outraged dignity. Maybe he had gone a little
too far. He attempted to temper the harshness of
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a-course,&#8221; he added deprecatingly, &#8220;meanin&#8217;
that anything like that would be likely to happen to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
you. Seein&#8217; as you didn&#8217;t exactly understand, I
wouldn&#8217;t take no steps against you.&#8221; And, even more
encouragingly, &#8220;I doubt if I&#8217;d hev any legal right to
proceed against anybody without seeing Den&ndash;&ndash;without
seeing the rightful owner first.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bit his tongue painfully in covering that slip,
but Dryad had not seemed to notice it. She crossed
back to the stove and in an absolute silence fell to
prodding with a fork beneath steaming lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really should have thought of that myself,&#8221;
she murmured pensively. &#8220;After seeing you return
from here every afternoon, I should have known he&ndash;&ndash;the
place had been left in your care.&#8221;</p>
<p>It rather startled him&ndash;&ndash;that half absent-minded
statement of hers&ndash;&ndash;it disturbed his confidence in his
command of the situation. Sitting there he told himself
that he should have realized long ago that she
could easily watch the hill road from the door of the
little drab cottage huddled at the end of Judge Maynard&#8217;s
acres.</p>
<p>He began to feel guilty again&ndash;&ndash;began to wonder
just how much his daily visits to Denny&#8217;s place had
led her to suspect. But Dryad did not wait for
any reply. She had turned once more until she was
facing him, her lips beginning to curl again, petal-like,
at the corners.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would have to interview the real owner
first?&#8221; she inquired insistently. &#8220;You do think that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
would be necessary before you could make me leave,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded&ndash;&ndash;nodded warily. Something in her
bearing put him on his guard. And then, before he
knew how it had happened, a little rush had carried
her across the room and she was kneeling at his feet,
her face upflung to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to interview me,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the words
trembled madly, breathlessly, from her lips. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to interview me&ndash;&ndash;because&ndash;&ndash;because I own it all&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;every
bit of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she laughed up at him&ndash;&ndash;laughed with a queer,
choking, strained note catching in her throat up into
his blankly incredulous face. He felt her thin young
arms tighten about him; he even half caught her
next hysterical words in spite of his amazement, and
for all that they were quite meaningless to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear,&#8221; she rushed on. &#8220;O, you dear, dear
stubborn old fraud! I punished you, didn&#8217;t I? You
were frightened&ndash;&ndash;afraid I&#8217;d go! You know you
were! As if I&#8217;d ever leave until&ndash;&ndash;until&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
failed to finish that sentence. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll never, never
tease you so again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there came that lightning-like change of mood
which always left him breathless in his inability to
follow it. The mirth went out of her eyes&ndash;&ndash;her lips
drooped and began to work strangely as she knelt and
gazed up at him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I bought his mortgage,&#8221; she told him slowly. &#8220;I
bought it from Judge Maynard a week ago with part
of the money he gave me for our place there below
his. He was very generous. Somehow I feel that
he paid me&ndash;&ndash;much more than it was worth. He&#8217;s
always wanted it and&ndash;&ndash;and I&ndash;&ndash;there wasn&#8217;t any need
for me to stay there any more, was there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry had never seen a face so terribly earnest
before&ndash;&ndash;so hungrily wistful&ndash;&ndash;but it was the light that
glowed in that kneeling girl&#8217;s eyes that held him
dumb. It left him completely incapable of coherent
thought, yet mechanically his mind leaped back to that
night, two weeks before, when Young Denny had
stumbled and gone floundering to his knees before
her, there on that very threshold. The boy&#8217;s own
words had painted that picture for him too vividly
for him to forget. And he knew, without reasoning
it out, just from the world of pain there in her eyes,
that she, too, at that moment was thinking of that
limp figure&ndash;&ndash;of the great red gash across its chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t help him,&#8221; she went on, and now her
voice was little more than a whisper. &#8220;I went and
left him here alone&ndash;&ndash;and hurt&ndash;&ndash;when I should have
stayed, that night when he went away. And so I
bought it&ndash;&ndash;I bought it because I thought some day
he might come back&ndash;&ndash;and need me even more. I
thought if he did come&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d feel as though he had
just&ndash;&ndash;come back home! And&ndash;&ndash;and just to be here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
waiting, I thought, too, might somehow help me to
have faith that he would come, some day&ndash;&ndash;safe!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man felt the fiercely tense little arms go
slack then. Her head went forward and lay heavy,
pillowed in her hands upon his knees. But he sat
there for a full minute, staring down at the thick,
shimmering mass of her hair, swallowing an unaccountable
lump that bothered his breathing preparatory
to telling her all that he had kept waiting for
just that opportunity, before he realized that she was
crying. And for an equally long period he cast desperately
about for the right thing to say. It came
to him finally&ndash;&ndash;a veritable inspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t want to cry,&#8221; he told her slowly.
&#8220;They&ndash;&ndash;they ain&#8217;t nothing to worry about now! For
if that&#8217;s the case&ndash;&ndash;if you&#8217;ve gone to work and bought
it, why, I ain&#8217;t got no more jurisdiction over it&ndash;&ndash;none
whatever!&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately she lifted her head and gazed long
and questioningly at him, but Old Jerry&#8217;s face was
only guilelessly grave. It was more than that&ndash;&ndash;benevolent
reassurance lit up every feature, and little by
little her brimming eyes began to clear; they began
to glisten with that baffling delight that had irritated
him so before. She slipped slowly to her feet and
stood and gazed down at him. Old Jerry knew then
that he would never again see so radiant a face as hers
was at that moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t crying because I was worried,&#8221; she said,
and she managed not to laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing
that every night, all night long, for two weeks. That
was before I understood&ndash;&ndash;things! But today&ndash;&ndash;this
afternoon I found something&ndash;&ndash;read something&ndash;&ndash;that
made me understand better. I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m just crying a
little tonight because I am so glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry couldn&#8217;t quite fathom the whole meaning
of those last words of hers. They surprised
him so that all the things he had meant to tell her
right then of Young Denny&#8217;s departure once more
went totally out of mind. He wondered if it was
the red-headlined account of his first battle that
she had seen. No matter how doubtful it was
he felt it was very, very possible, for at each
day&#8217;s end he had been leaving Denny&#8217;s roll of
papers there just as he had when the boy was at
home.</p>
<p>But the rest of it he understood in spite of the
wonder of it all. Whenever he remembered Young
Denny asprawl upon the floor it seemed to him a
thing too marvelous for belief, and yet, recalling the
light that had glowed radiant in that girl&#8217;s eyes, he
knew it was the only thing left to believe.</p>
<p>He talked it over with himself that night on the
way home.</p>
<p>&#8220;She bought it so&#8217;s if he ever did want to come
back, he&#8217;d feel as if he had come back home,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
repeated her words, and he pondered long upon them.
There was only one possible deduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought he wouldn&#8217;t have nothing left to buy
it back when he did come&ndash;&ndash;that he&#8217;d be started on
the road all the rest of &#8217;em traveled and pretty well&ndash;&ndash;shot&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;pieces!
That&#8217;s what she thought,&#8221; he
decided.</p>
<p>He shook his head over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he marveled. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
know how that old jug really got broke&ndash;&ndash;because I
ain&#8217;t told her yet! But she&#8217;s waitin&#8217; for him just the
same&ndash;&ndash;just a-waitin&#8217; for him, no matter how he
comes. Figurin&#8217; on takin&#8217; care of him, too&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
what she was doin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;her that ain&#8217;t no bigger&#8217;n his
little finger!&#8221;</p>
<p>The storm had blown over long before his buggy
went rattling down that long hill, and he sat with the
reins dangling neglected between his knees and
squinted up at the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always did consider I&#8217;d been pretty lucky,&#8221; he
confided after a time to the plump mare&#8217;s lazily flopping
ears, &#8220;never gettin&#8217; mixed up in any matrimonial
tangle, so to speak. But now&ndash;&ndash;now I ain&#8217;t quite so
sure.&#8221; A lonesome note crept into the querulous
voice. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d hev kept my eyes open a little
mite wider&#8217;n I did if I&#8217;d ever a-dreamed anybody
could care like that.... Don&#8217;t happen very
often though, I reckon. Just about once in a lifetime,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
maybe. Maybe, if he ain&#8217;t too blind to see
it when it does come ... maybe once to every
man!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That next week marked the beginning of an intimacy
unlike anything which Old Jerry had ever
before known in all his life, for in spite of the girl&#8217;s
absolute proprietorship he continued his daily trips
up the long hill, not only for the purpose of leaving
Young Denny&#8217;s bundle of papers and seed catalogues,
but to attend to the stock which the boy had left in
his care as well. It never occurred to him that that
duty was only optional with him now.</p>
<p>He never again attempted either, after that night,
to explain his delinquency and deliver Young Denny&#8217;s
message to her. There seemed to him absolutely no
need now to open a subject which was bound to be
embarrassing to him. And then, too, a sort of tacit
understanding appeared to have sprung up between
them that needed no further explanation.</p>
<p>Only once was the temptation to confess to her the
real reason for Denny&#8217;s sudden going almost stronger
than he could resist. That was quite a month later,
when the news of the boy&#8217;s second battle was flaunted
broadcast by the same red-headlined sheet. Then
for days he considered the advisability of such a
move.</p>
<p>It was not some one to share his hot pride that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
wanted; he had lived his whole life almost entirely
within himself, and so his elation was no less keen
because he had no second person with whom to discuss
the victory. He wanted her opinion on a quite
different question&ndash;&ndash;a question which he felt utterly
incapable of deciding for himself. It was no less a
plan than that he should be present at the match
which was already hinted at between &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8221;
and Jed The Red&ndash;&ndash;Jeddy Conway, from that very
village.</p>
<p>There were days when he almost felt that she
knew of this new perplexity of his, felt that she really
had seen that account of Young Denny&#8217;s first fight and
had been watching for the second, and at such times
only a mumbled excuse and a hasty retreat saved him
from baring his secret desire.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d think I&#8217;d gone stark crazy,&#8221; he excused his
lack of courage. &#8220;She&#8217;d say I was a-goin&#8217; into my
second childhood!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet in the end it was the girl with the tip-tilted
eyes who decided it for him.</p>
<p>Spring had slipped into early summer when the
day came which made the gossip of &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s&#8221;
possible bid for the championship a certainty. It was
harder than ever for Old Jerry after that. Each fresh
day&#8217;s issue brought forth a long and exhaustive comparison
of the two men&#8217;s chances&ndash;&ndash;of their strength
and weaknesses. The technical discussion the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
man skipped; it was undecipherable to him and
enough that Young Denny was hailed as a certain
winner.</p>
<p>And then as the day set for the match crept nearer
and nearer, he began to notice a new and alarming
change in the tone of that daily column. At first
it was only fleeting&ndash;&ndash;too intangible for one to place
one&#8217;s finger upon it. But by the end of another week
it was openly inquiring whether &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8221; had
as much as an even chance of winning after all.</p>
<p>It bewildered Old Jerry; it was beyond his comprehension,
and had he not been so depressed himself
he would have noted the change that came over
the girl, too, these days. He never entered the big
back kitchen now to hear her humming softly to
herself, and sometimes he had to speak several times
before she even heard him.</p>
<p>That continued for almost a week, and then there
came a day, a scant three days before the date which
he had hungrily underlined in red upon a mental calendar,
which brought the whole vexing indecision to a
precipitate head.</p>
<p>Old Jerry read that day&#8217;s column in the sporting
extra with weazened face going red with anger&ndash;&ndash;read
it with fists knotted. Those others had been
merely skeptical&ndash;&ndash;doubtful of &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s&#8221; willingness
to meet the champion&ndash;&ndash;and now it openly
scoffed at him; it laughed at his ability, lashed him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
with ridicule. And, to cap it all, it accused him openly
of having already &#8220;sold out&#8221; to his opponent.</p>
<p>When the little white-haired driver of the buggy
reached the house on the hill that night he was as
pale as he had been red, hours before, and he pleaded
fatigue to excuse his too hasty departure. He did
not see that she was almost as openly eager to have
him go or that she almost ran across to the table under
the light with the packet of papers as he turned
away.</p>
<p>Had he noticed he would have been better prepared
the next night for the scene that met him when
he opened her door at dusk. One step was all he
took, and then he stopped, wide-eyed, aghast. Dryad
was standing in the middle of the room, her hair
loose about her shoulders, lips drawn dangerously
back from tight little teeth, fists clenched at her throat,
and her eyes flaming.</p>
<p>Old Jerry had never before seen her in a rage; he
had never before seen anybody so terribly, pallidly
violent. As he entered her eyes shot up to his. He
heard her breath come and go, come and go, between
dry lips. And suddenly she lifted her feet and
stamped upon the newspaper strewn about her on the
floor&ndash;&ndash;infinitesimal shreds which she had torn and
flung from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lie&ndash;&ndash;a lie! They
said he couldn&#8217;t win anyway; they said he had sold&ndash;&ndash;sold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
his chance to win&ndash;&ndash;and they lie! He&#8217;s never
been whipped. He&#8217;s never&ndash;&ndash;been&ndash;&ndash;whipped&ndash;&ndash;yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>It frightened him. The very straining of her
throat and the mad rise and fall of her breast made
him afraid for her. In his effort to quiet her he
hardly reckoned what he was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&ndash;&ndash;it don&#8217;t mean nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he stated mildly.
&#8220;That newspaper trash ain&#8217;t no account, anyway you
look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why do they print it?&#8221; she stormed. &#8220;How
do they dare to print it? They&#8217;ve been doing it for
days&ndash;&ndash;weeks!&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt more equal to that question. The answer
fairly popped into his brain.</p>
<p>&#8220;They hev to, I reckon,&#8221; he said with a fine semblance
of cheerfulness. &#8220;If they didn&#8217;t maybe everybody&#8217;d
be so sure he&#8217;d win that they wouldn&#8217;t even
bother to go to see it.&#8221; And then, very carelessly, as
though it was of little importance: &#8220;Don&#8217;t know&#8217;s
I would hev thought of goin&#8217; myself if it hadn&#8217;t been
for that. It&#8217;s advertisin&#8217; I reckon&ndash;&ndash;just advertisin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her fists came down from her chin; her whole body
relaxed. It was that bewildering change of mood
which he could never hope to follow. She even started
toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have thought of it!&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, you don&#8217;t mean that you <i>aren&#8217;t</i> going?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was quite as though she had never considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the possibility of such a contingency. Old Jerry&#8217;s
mouth dropped open while he stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;me go! Why, it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
happen tomorrow night!&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her head in apparent unconsciousness
of his astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to leave on the early train,&#8221; she
agreed, &#8220;and&ndash;&ndash;and so I won&#8217;t see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her back upon him for a moment. He
realized that she was fumbling inside the throat of
the little, too-tight blouse. When she faced him again
there was something in the palm of her outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you to come tonight,&#8221; she
went on, &#8220;and it was hard waiting. That&#8217;s why I
tore the paper up, I think. And now, will you&ndash;&ndash;will
you give him this for me&ndash;&ndash;give it to him when he has
won? You won&#8217;t have to say anything.&#8221; She hesitated.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I think he&#8217;ll understand!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry reached out and took it from her&ndash;&ndash;a
bit of a red silk bow, dotted with silver spangles. He
gazed at it a moment before he tucked it away in
an inside pocket, and in that moment of respite his
brain raced madly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I figured on goin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, when
his breath returned, &#8220;but I been a little undecided&ndash;&ndash;jest
a trifle! But I ought to be there; he might be
a mite anxious if they wasn&#8217;t somebody from home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
And I&#8217;ll give it to him then&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll give it to him when
he&#8217;s won!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went a bit unsteadily back to his waiting buggy.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had that all ready to give me,&#8221; he said to
himself as he climbed up to the high seat. Tentatively
his fingers touched the little lump that the spangly
bow of red made inside his coat. &#8220;She&#8217;s had it all
ready for me&ndash;&ndash;mebby for days! But how&#8217;d she
know I was a-goin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;How&#8217;d
<i>she</i> know, when I didn&#8217;t know myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave it up as a feminine whimsicality too deep
for mere male wisdom. Once on the way back he
thought of the route that would go mailless the next
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt &#8217;em none to wait a day or so,&#8221; he
stated, and his voice was just a little tinged with
importance. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;ll do &#8217;em good. And there
ain&#8217;t no way out of it, anyhow&ndash;&ndash;for I surely got to
be there!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Morehouse did not hear the door in the
opaque glass partition that walled his desk
off from the outer editorial offices open and
close, for all that it was very quiet. Ever since the
hour which followed the going to press of the afternoon
edition of the paper the huge room, with its
littered floor and flat-topped tables, had been deserted,
so still that the buzzing of a blue-bottle fly against
the window pane at Morehouse&#8217;s side seemed irritatingly
loud by contrast.</p>
<p>The plump newspaperman in brown was too deeply
preoccupied to hear anything so timidly unobtrusive
as was that interruption, and only after the intruder
had plucked nervously at the elbow that supported
his chin did he realize that he was not alone. His
head came up then, slowly, until he was gazing back
into the eyes of the little, attenuated old man who,
head tilted birdlike to one side, was standing beside
him in uncomfortable, apologetic silence.</p>
<p>It surprised Morehouse more than a little. For
the life of him he couldn&#8217;t have told just whom he
had expected to see when he looked up, but nothing
could have startled him more than the presence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
that white-haired wisp of a man with the beady eyes
who fitted almost uncannily into the perplexing puzzle
which had held him there at his desk until dusk. He
forgot to greet the newcomer. Instead he sat gazing
at him, wide-mouthed, and after Old Jerry had borne
the scrutiny as long as he could he took the initiative
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I got here,&#8221; he quavered. &#8220;I been a-tryin&#8217;
to get upstairs to see you ever since about three
o&#8217;clock, and they wouldn&#8217;t let me in. Said you was
too busy to be bothered, even when I told &#8217;em I belonged
to the Gov&#8217;mint service. But I managed to
slip by &#8217;em at last!&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and waited for some word of commendation.
Morehouse merely nodded. He was
thinking&ndash;&ndash;thinking hard! The voice was almost as
familiar to him as was his own, and yet it persisted
in tantalizing his memory. He couldn&#8217;t quite place
it. Old Jerry sensed something of his difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Boltonwood,&#8221; he introduced himself,
not quite so uncertainly. &#8220;I&#8217;m Old Jerry. Maybe
you remember me&ndash;&ndash;I sat just next the stove that
night you was in town a-huntin&#8217; news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Morehouse remembered. Old Jerry had not
had much to say that night, but his face and his shrill
eagerness to snatch a little of the spotlight was unforgettable.
And it was of that very night Morehouse
had been thinking&ndash;&ndash;that and the face of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
big boy silent there on the threshold&ndash;&ndash;when the interruption
came. But still he uttered no welcome; instead
there was something close akin to distinct aversion
in his manner as he drew up a chair for the old
man.</p>
<p>Old Jerry felt the chill lack of cordiality, but he
sat down. And after a long period of silence, in which
Morehouse made no move to put him more at ease,
he swallowed hard and went on with his explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I come down to&ndash;&ndash;to see Denny fight,&#8221; he stated.
&#8220;It kinda seemed to us&ndash;&ndash;to me&ndash;&ndash;that he&#8217;d think it
strange if somebody from his home town wa&#8217;n&#8217;t there.
So I come along. And I wouldn&#8217;t a bothered you at
all today&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s gettin&#8217; late and I ain&#8217;t got my ticket
to get in yet&ndash;&ndash;only&ndash;&ndash;only I was worried a mite&ndash;&ndash;jest
a trifle&ndash;&ndash;and I thought I&#8217;d better see you if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morehouse tilted his head again.</p>
<p>Old Jerry gave up any attempt of further excusing
his intrusion and went straight to the heart of the
matter. He unfolded a paper that bulged from the
side pocket of his coat and spread it out on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this,&#8221; he said, indicating the column that had
scoffed so openly at Young Denny&#8217;s chances. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you
wrote it, I suppose, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again that impersonal nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I just wanted to ask you if&ndash;&ndash;if you really
thought it was&ndash;&ndash;if you think he ain&#8217;t got no chance
at all?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>The eagerness of that trembling old voice was
not to be ignored any longer. But Morehouse couldn&#8217;t
help but recollect the eager circle of &#8220;Ayes&#8221; which
had flanked the Judge that other night.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; he inquired coolly. &#8220;What if he
hasn&#8217;t? I though Jed Conway was the particular
pride of your locality!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jerry&#8217;s beady eyes widened. There was no
mistaking the positive dislike in that round face,
any more than one could misunderstand the antagonism
of that round-faced man&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>For weeks Morehouse had been puzzling over a
question which he could not answer&ndash;&ndash;something
which, for all the intimacy that had sprung up between
himself and Denny Bolton, he had never felt able to
ask of the boy with the grave eyes and graver lips.
Even since the conference in Hogarty&#8217;s little office,
when he had agreed to the ex-lightweight&#8217;s plan, it
had been vexing him, no nearer solution than it had
been that day when he assured Hogarty that there was
more behind young Denny&#8217;s eagerness to meet Jed Conway
than the prize-money could account for.</p>
<p>Now, that afternoon, on the very eve of that battle,
he sat there in the thickening dusk, unconscious of
the passage of time, and listened to the explanation
that came pouring from Old Jerry&#8217;s lips, haltingly at
first, and then in a steady falsetto stream, and learned
the answer to it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>The old mail carrier didn&#8217;t know what he was
doing. His one desire was to vindicate himself in
the cold eyes of the man before him. But he told it
well and he did not spare himself.</p>
<p>Once he though he caught a glimpse of thawing
mirth in that face when he had finished relating how
Denny had led him, reluctant and fearful, from the
kitchen of the farmhouse to the spot of blood on the
stable wall, and from there to the jug in a heap of
fragments against the tree-butt. And that fleeting
mirth became a warm, all-enveloping grin when he
had detailed the climax of the Judge&#8217;s prearranged
sensation that same night.</p>
<p>He knew then that he had set himself right, and
he did not mean to go into it any more fully. It
was the changed attitude of Morehouse that led him
on and on. So he told, too, of Dryad Anderson&#8217;s
purchase of the bleak old place on the hill and her
reason. But when it came to her wild fury against
the paper that had dared to scoff at the boy he paused.
For a second he calculated the wisdom of exhibiting
the bit of a red bow that had been entrusted him. It,
without a doubt, would be the only passport he could
hope for to a share of the glory, when it was all
over. For the time being he jealously decided to let
it wait, and he turned back to the rumpled sheet
upon the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;d be mighty disappointed,&#8221; he finished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
a little lamely. &#8220;She&#8217;s so sure, somehow, it kinda
worries me. You&ndash;&ndash;you do think he&#8217;s got a little
chance, don&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;jest a trifle?&#8221;</p>
<p>It took a long time&ndash;&ndash;Old Jerry&#8217;s confession. It
was dark before he finished, but Morehouse did not
interrupt him by so much as the lifting of a finger.
And he sat silent, gazing straight ahead of him,
after the old man had finished. Old Jerry, watching
him, wondered vaguely what made his eyes so bright
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it, is it?&#8221; the plump man murmured at
last. &#8220;So that&#8217;s it. And I never dreamed of it once.
I must be going stale.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled in his chair until he faced Old Jerry
full.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A half-hour before you
came in I didn&#8217;t like even to think of it. But now&ndash;&ndash;chance?
Well, this deadly waiting is over anyhow,
and we&#8217;ll soon know. And I wonder&ndash;&ndash;now&ndash;&ndash;I wonder!&#8221;</p>
<p>With his watch flat in the palm of his hand Morehouse
sat and whistled softly. And then he shot hastily
to his feet. Old Jerry understood that whistle,
but he hung back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I ain&#8217;t got my ticket yet,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>Morehouse merely reached in and hustled him over
the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your unabridged edition, while it has no doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
saved my sanity, has robbed us both of food and
drink,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;There&#8217;s no time left, even for
friendly argument, if you want to be there when it
happens. You won&#8217;t need any ticket this time&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll
be with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even at that they were late, for when they paused
a moment in the entrance of the huge, bowl-shaped
amphitheater, a sharp gust of hand-clapping, broken
by shrill whistling and shriller cat-calls, met them.
Far out across that room Old Jerry saw two figures,
glistening damp under the lights, crawl through the
ropes that penned in a high-raised platform in the
very center of the building, and disappear up an
aisle.</p>
<p>He turned a dismayed face to Morehouse who, with
one hand clutching his arm, was deeply engrossed in
a whispered conversation with a man at the entrance&ndash;&ndash;too
engrossed to see. But when the newspaperman
turned at last to lead the way down into
the body of the house he explained in one brief word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Preliminary,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Old Jerry did not understand. But half dragged,
half led, he followed blindly after his guide, until he
found himself wedged into a seat at the very edge of
that roped-off, canvas-padded area. It was a single
long bench with a narrow board desk, set elbow high,
running the entire length in front of it. Peering half
fearfully from the corner of his eye Old Jerry realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
that there were at least a full dozen men beside
themselves wedged in before it, and that, like Morehouse,
there was a block of paper before each man.</p>
<p>The awe with which the immensity of the place had
stunned him began to lessen a little and allowed him
to look around. Wherever he turned a sea of faces
met him&ndash;&ndash;faces strangely set and strained. Even
under the joviality of those closest to him he saw the
tightened sinews of their jaws. Those further away
were blurred by the smoke that rose in a never-thinning
cloud, blurred until there was nothing but indistinct
blotches of white in the outer circles of seats.</p>
<p>And when he lifted his head and looked above him,
he gasped. They were there, too, tiny, featureless
dots of white, like nothing so much as holes in a black
wall, in the smoke-drift that alternately hid and revealed
them.</p>
<p>Faces of men&ndash;&ndash;faces of men, wherever he turned
his head! Faces strained and tense as they waited.
That terrible tensity got under his skin after a while;
it crept in upon him until his spine crawled a little,
as if from cold. It was quiet, too; oddly quiet in
spite of the dull mumble that rose from thousands of
throats.</p>
<p>Twice that hush was broken&ndash;&ndash;twice when men
laden with pails of water, and bottles and sponges, and
thick white towels crowded through the ropes in
front of him. Then the whole house was swept by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
a premature storm of hand-clapping for the men who,
stripped save for the flat shoes upon their feet and
the trunks about their hips, followed them into the
ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preliminary!&#8221; Morehouse had said, and there had
been something of disinterested contempt in his voice.
Old Jerry felt, too, the entire great crowd&#8217;s disinterested,
good-natured tolerance. They were waiting
for something else.</p>
<p>Twice Morehouse left his place at the long board
desk and wended his way off through the maze of
aisles. The second time he returned, after the third
match had been finished, Old Jerry caught sight of
his face while he was a long way off&ndash;&ndash;and Old Jerry&#8217;s
breath caught in his throat. His plump cheeks were
pale when he crowded back into his place. The old
man leaned nearer and tried to ask a question and his
dry tongue refused. The plump reporter nodded his
head.</p>
<p>Again the men came with their bottles of water&ndash;&ndash;their
pails&ndash;&ndash;their towels and sponges. There was
a third man who slipped agilely into the nearest
corner. Old Jerry saw him turn once and nod reassuringly,
he thought, at Morehouse. The little mail
carrier did not know him; everybody else within a
radius of yards had apparently recognized him, but
he could not take his eyes off that lean, hard face.
There was a kind of satanic, methodical deadliness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
in Hogarty&#8217;s directions to the other two men inside
the ropes.</p>
<p>Even while he was staring at him, fascinated, that
hand-clapping stormed up again, and then swelled
to a hoarse roar that went hammering to the roof.
A figure passed Old Jerry, so close that the long robe
which wrapped him brushed his knee. When Hogarty
had stripped the robe away and the figure went
on&ndash;&ndash;on up through the ropes&ndash;&ndash;he recognized him.</p>
<p>As Young Denny seated himself in the corner just
above them Morehouse threw out his arm and forced
Old Jerry back into his seat. Then the little man
remembered and shrank back, but his eyes glowed.
He forgot to watch for the coming of the other
in dumb amaze at the wide expanse of the boy&#8217;s
shoulders that rose white as the narrow cloth that
encircled his hips. Dazed, he listened to them shouting
the name by which they knew him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;The Pilgrim&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and
he did not turn away until Jed Conway
was in the ring.</p>
<p>He heard first the cheers that greeted the newcomer&ndash;&ndash;broken
reiterations of &#8220;Oh, you Red!&#8221; But
the same heartiness was not there, nor the volume.
When Old Jerry&#8217;s eyes crept furtively across the ring
he understood the reason.</p>
<p>It was the same face that he had known before,
older and heavier, but the same. And there was no
appeal in that face. It was scant of brow, brutish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
supercunning, and the swarthy body that rose above
the black hip-cloth matched the face. Old Jerry&#8217;s
eyes clung to the thick neck that ran from his ears
straight down into his shoulders until a nameless dread
took him by the throat and made him turn away.</p>
<p>Back in Denny&#8217;s corner Hogarty was lacing on the
gloves, talking softly in the meantime to the big boy
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the tap of the gong,&#8221; he was droning.
&#8220;From the tap of the gong&ndash;&ndash;from the tap of the
gong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Denny nodded, smiled faintly as he rose to
his feet to meet the announcer, who crossed and placed
one hand on his shoulder and introduced him. Again
the applause went throbbing to the roof; and again
the echo of it after Jed The Red had in turn stood
up in his corner.</p>
<p>The referee called them to the middle of the ring.
It was quiet in an instant&ndash;&ndash;so quiet that Old Jerry&#8217;s
throat ached with it. The announcer lifted his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jed The Red fights at one hundred and ninety-six,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;&#8216;The Pilgrim&#8217; at one hundred and
seventy-two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately he turned and dropped through the
ropes. His going was accompanied by a flurry in
each corner as the seconds scuttled after him with
stools and buckets.</p>
<p>They faced each other, alone in the ring save for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
the referee&ndash;&ndash;The Pilgrim and Jed The Red. Then
a gong struck. They reached out and each touched
the glove of the other.</p>
<p>Old Jerry could not follow it&ndash;&ndash;it came too terribly
swift for that&ndash;&ndash;but he heard the thudding impact of
gloves as Denny hurtled forward in that first savage
rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the gong,&#8221; Hogarty had ordered, &#8220;from
the gong!&#8221; The Red, covering and ducking, blocking
and swaying beneath the whirlwind of that attack,
broke and staggered and set himself, only to break
again, and retreat, foot by foot, around the ring.
The whole house had come to its feet with the first
rush, screaming to a man. Old Jerry, too, was
standing up, giddy, dizzy, as he watched Conway
weather that first minute.</p>
<p>He had no chance to swing; with both hands covering
he fought wildly to stay on his feet; to live through
it; to block that right hand that lashed out again and
again and found his face.</p>
<p>Each time that blow went across it shook him to
the soles of his feet; it lifted the cheering of the
crowd to a higher, madder key; but even Old Jerry,
eyes a little quicker already, saw that none of those
blows landed flush upon the side of the jaw.</p>
<p>Conway called to his aid all the ring-generalship
of which he was capable in that opening round. Once
that lightening-like fist reached out and found his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
mouth. A trickle of blood oozed red from the lips
that puffed up, almost before the glove came away;
once when he had seen an opening and led for The
Pilgrim&#8217;s own face, that wicked jolt caught him wide
open. He ducked his head between his shoulders
then. The shock sent him to his knees, but that upraised
shoulder saved him. The force of that glancing
smash had spent itself before it reached his unprotected
neck.</p>
<p>There was no let-up&ndash;&ndash;no lull in the relentless advance.
He was on his feet again, grim, grasping,
reeling, hanging on! And again that avalanche of
destruction enveloped him.</p>
<p>He fought to drop into a clinch, for one breath&#8217;s
respite, his huge hairy arms slipping hungrily out
about Denny&#8217;s white body, but even as he snuggled
his body close in, that fist lashed up between them
and found his chin again. It straightened him, flung
him back. And once more, before the certain annihilation
of that blow, he ducked his head in between
his shoulders.</p>
<p>Old Jerry heard the crash of the glove against
the top of his head; he saw Conway hurled back
into the ropes. But not until seconds later, when
he realized that the roar of the crowd had hushed,
did he see that a change had come over the fight.</p>
<p>Conway was no longer giving ground; he was
himself driving in more and more viciously, for that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
deadly right hand no longer leaped out to check him.
Twice just as Denny had rocked him he now jolted
his own right over to The Pilgrim&#8217;s face. At each
blow the boy lashed out with his left hand. Both
blows he missed, and the second time the force of his
swing whirled him against the barrier. Right and
left Conway sent his gloves crashing into his unprotected
stomach&ndash;&ndash;right and left!</p>
<p>And then the tap of the gong!</p>
<p>Hogarty was through the ropes with the bell. As
Denny dropped upon the stool he stripped the glove
from the boy&#8217;s right hand and examined it with anxious
fingers. The other two were sponging his chest
with water&ndash;&ndash;pumping fresh air into his lungs; but Old
Jerry&#8217;s eyes clung to the calamity written upon Hogarty&#8217;s
gray features.</p>
<p>Everybody else seemed to understand what had
happened&ndash;&ndash;everybody but himself. He turned again
to the man next him on the bench. Morehouse, too,
had been watching the ex-lightweight&#8217;s deft fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broken,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;His right hand is gone.&#8221;
And after what seemed hours Old Jerry realized that
Morehouse was cursing hoarsely.</p>
<p>In Conway&#8217;s corner the activity was doubly feverish.
The Red lay sprawled back against the ropes
while they kneaded knotty legs, and shoulders. There
was blood on his chin, his lips were cut and misshapen,
but he had weathered that round without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
serious damage. Watching him Old Jerry saw that
he was smiling&ndash;&ndash;snarling confidently.</p>
<p>Back in Denny&#8217;s corner they were still working
over him, but the whole house had sensed the dismay
in that little knot of men. Hogarty, gnawing
his lip, stopped and whispered once to the boy on the
stool, but Young Denny shook his head and held out
his hand. He laced the gloves back on them, over
the purple, puffy knuckles.</p>
<p>And then again that cataclysmic bell.</p>
<p>Just as the first round had started, that second one
opened with a rush, but this time it was Conway who
forced the fighting. Like some gigantic projectile
he drove in and caught Denny in his own corner, and
beat him back against the standard. Again that thudding
right and left, right and left, into the stomach.
And again Old Jerry saw that left hand flash out&ndash;&ndash;and
miss.</p>
<p>Just as The Pilgrim had driven him Conway
forced Denny around the ring, except that the boy
was heart-breaking slow in getting away. The Red
stayed with him, beat him back and back, smothered
him! With that deadly right no longer hunting for
his jaw, he fought with nothing to fear, for Young
Denny could not find his face even once with that
flashing left swing.</p>
<p>Before the round was half over The Pilgrim had
gone down twice&ndash;&ndash;body blows that did little harm;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
but they were shouting for The Red&ndash;&ndash;shouting as if
from a great distance, from the balconies.</p>
<p>Again Conway drove him into a corner of the
ropes, feinted for the stomach. Then there came
that first blow that found his chin. Old Jerry saw
Denny&#8217;s body go limp as he crashed his length upon
the padded canvas; he saw him try to rise and heard
the house screaming for him to take the count.</p>
<p>He rested there for a precious instant, swaying
on one knee. But his eyes were still glazed when he
rose, and again Conway, rushing, beat down that
guarding right, and, swinging with all his shoulder
weight behind it, found that same spot and dropped
him again.</p>
<p>Pandemonium broke loose in the upper reaches
of the seats, but the silence of the body of the house
was deathlike as he lay without stirring. Old Jerry
gulped and waited&ndash;&ndash;choked back a sobbing breath
as he saw him start to lift himself once more. Upon
his hands and knees first, then upon his knees alone.
And then, with eyes shut, he struggled up, at the count
of ten, and shaped up again.</p>
<p>And Conway beat him down.</p>
<p>Even the gallery was quiet now. The thud of that
stiff-armed jolt went to every corner of that vast room.
And the referee was droning out the count again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;Five&ndash;&ndash;six&ndash;&ndash;seven&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Head sagging between his arms, eyes staring and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
sightless, The Pilgrim groped out and found the
ropes. Once more at the end of the toll he lifted
himself&ndash;&ndash;lifted himself by the strength of his shoulders
to his legs that tottered beneath him, and then
stepped free of the ropes.</p>
<p>That time, before Conway could swing, the gong
saved him.</p>
<p>Again it was Hogarty who was first through the
ropes. Effortlessly he stooped and lifted that limp
body and carried it across to the stool. They tried to
stretch him back against the ropes behind him, and
each time his head slumped forward over his knees.</p>
<p>Old Jerry turned toward Morehouse and choked&ndash;&ndash;licked
his lips and choked again. And Morehouse
nodded his head dumbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Old Jerry sat and stared back at him as though he
couldn&#8217;t understand. He remembered the bit of a red
bow in his pocket then; he fumbled inside and found
it. He remembered the eyes of the girl who had given
it to him, too, that night when she had knelt at his
knees. His old fingers closed, viselike, upon the fat
man&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she told me to give him this,&#8221; he mumbled
dully. &#8220;Why, she&ndash;&ndash;she said for me to give him this,
when he had <i>Won</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morehouse stared at the bit of tinseled silk&ndash;&ndash;stared
up at Old Jerry&#8217;s face and back again. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
then he leaned over suddenly and picked it up. The
next moment he was crowding out from behind the
desk&ndash;&ndash;was climbing into the ring.</p>
<p>Old Jerry saw him fling fiercely tense words into
Hogarty&#8217;s face, and Hogarty stood back. He knelt
before the slack body on the stool and tried to raise
the head; he held the bit of bright web before him,
but there was no recognition in Denny&#8217;s eyes. And
the old man heard the plump reporter&#8217;s words, sob-like
with excitement:</p>
<p>&#8220;She sent it,&#8221; he hammered at those deaf ears.
&#8220;She sent it&ndash;&ndash;she sent it&ndash;&ndash;silk&ndash;&ndash;a little bow of red
silk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the whole vast house saw the change that
came over that limp form. They saw the slack shoulders
begin to go back; saw the dead-white face come
up; they saw those sick eyes beginning to clear. And
The Pilgrim smiled a little&ndash;&ndash;smiled into Morehouse&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silk,&#8221; he repeated softly. &#8220;Silk!&#8221; and then, as
if it had all come back at once: &#8220;Silk&ndash;&ndash;next to her
skin!&#8221;</p>
<p>And they called it a miracle&ndash;&ndash;that recovery. They
called it a miracle of the mind over a body already
beaten beyond endurance. For in the scant thirty
seconds which were left, while the boy lay back
with them working desperately above him, it was almost
possible to see the strength ebbing back into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
veins. They dashed water upon his head, inverted
bottles of it into his face, and emptied it from his
eyes, but during that long half minute the vague smile
never left his lips&ndash;&ndash;nor his eyes the face of Conway
across from him.</p>
<p>And he went to meet The Red when the gong called
to them again. He went to meet him&ndash;&ndash;smiling!</p>
<p>The bell seemed to pick him up and drop him in the
middle of the ring. Set for the shock he stopped
Conway&#8217;s hurtling attack. And when The Red swung
he tightened, took the blow flush on the side of the
face, and only rocked a little.</p>
<p>Conway&#8217;s chin seemed to lift to receive the blow
which he started then from the waist. That right
hand, flashing up, found it and straightened The Red
back&ndash;&ndash;lifted him to his toes. And while he was still
in the air The Pilgrim measured and swung. The
left glove caught him flush below the ear; it picked
him up and drove him crashing back into the corner
from which he had just come.</p>
<p>Old Jerry saw them bend over him&ndash;&ndash;saw them
pick him up at last and slip him through the ropes.
Then he realized that the referee was holding Young
Denny&#8217;s right hand aloft; that Hogarty, with arms
about him, was holding the boy erect.</p>
<p>The little mail-carrier heard the ex-lightweight&#8217;s
words, as he edged in beside Morehouse, against the
ropes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A world-beater,&#8221; he was screaming above the tumult.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a world-beater of you in a year!&#8221;</p>
<p>And The Pilgrim, still smiling vaguely, shook his
head a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he answered faintly. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll come
back. I don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;yet. But now&ndash;&ndash;now I reckon
I&#8217;d better be going along home!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a white night&ndash;&ndash;a night so brilliant that the
village lights far below in the hollow all but lost
their own identity in the radiance of that huge,
pale moon; so white that the yellow flare of the single
lamp in its bracket, in the back kitchen of the old
Bolton place on the hill seemed shabbily dull by contrast.</p>
<p>Standing at the window in the dark front room of
the house, peering out from under cupped palms that
hid her eyes, Dryad could almost pick out each separate
picket of the straggling old fence that bounded
the garden of the little drab cottage across from her.
In that searching light she could even make out great
patches where the rotting sheathing of the house had
been torn away, leaving the framework beneath naked
and gaunt and bare.</p>
<p>It was scarcely two months since the day when she
had gone herself to Judge Maynard with her offer to
sell that unkempt acre or so which he had fought so
long and bitterly to force into the market. And it
had been a strange one, too&ndash;&ndash;that interview. His
acceptance had been quick&ndash;&ndash;instantaneously eager&ndash;&ndash;but
the girl was still marvelling a little over his attitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
throughout that transaction, whenever her mind
turned back to it.</p>
<p>When she mentioned the mortgage which Young
Denny had secured only a few days before, he had
seemed to understand almost immediately why she
had spoken of it, without the explanation which she
meant to give.</p>
<p>Once again she found him a different Judge Maynard
from all the others she had known, and he had
in the years since she could remember, been many
different men to her imagination. It puzzled her
almost as much as did his opinion upon the value of
the old place, which, somehow, she could not bring
herself to believe was worth all that he insisted upon
paying. But then, too, she did not know either that
the town&#8217;s great man had been riding a-tilt at his own
soul, for several days on end, and just as Old Jerry
had done, was seizing upon the first opportunity to
salve the wounds resultant.</p>
<p>And yet this was the first day that the girl had seen
him so much as inspect his long-coveted property;
the first time she had known him to set foot within
the sagging gate since he had placed in her hands that
sum of money which was greater than any she had
ever seen before. Under his directions men had commenced
clearing away the rank shrubbery that afternoon&ndash;&ndash;commenced
to tear down the house itself.</p>
<p>Time after time since morning she had entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
the front room to stand and peer out across the valley
at this new activity which the Judge himself was
directing with an oddly suppressed lack of his usual
violent gestures. There was something akin to apology
in his every move.</p>
<p>It brought a little homesick ache into the girl&#8217;s
throat; it set her lips to curving&ndash;&ndash;made her eyes go
damp with pity and tenderness for the little white-haired
figure bending over his bench. He had clung
so bravely, so stubbornly, to that battered bit of a
house; to his garden which he had never realized had
long since ceased to be anything but a plot of waist-high
bushes and weeds. Once when she recollected
those countless rows of poignantly wistful faces on
the shelves of that back-room workshop she wondered
if she had not been disloyal, after all. And she had
argued it out with herself aloud as she went from
task to task in that afternoon&#8217;s gathering twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was because of her that he stayed,&#8221; she
reassured herself. &#8220;It was because of her that he kept
it, all these years. And&ndash;&ndash;and so he couldn&#8217;t mind&ndash;&ndash;not
very much, I think, now that they don&#8217;t need it
any longer, if I sold it so that I could keep this place&ndash;&ndash;for
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been long, those hours of waiting. Not
a minute of those entire two days since Old Jerry&#8217;s
departure but had dragged by on laggard feet. And
yet now, with nightfall of that third day she became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
jealous of every passing minute. She hated to have
them pass; dreaded to watch the creeping hands of the
clock on the kitchen wall as they drew up, little by
little, upon that hour which meant the arrival of the
night train in the village.</p>
<p>One moment she wondered if he would come&ndash;&ndash;wondered
and touched dry lips with the tip of her tongue.
And the very next, when somehow she was so very,
very sure that there was no room for doubt, she even
wondered whether or not he would be glad&ndash;&ndash;glad to
find her there. The gaunt skeleton of a framework
showing through the torn sides of John Anderson&#8217;s
cottage almost unnerved her whenever that thought
came, and sent her out again into the lighted back
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he isn&#8217;t?&#8221; she whispered, over and over
again. &#8220;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;I never thought of that before, did
I? I just thought I had to be here when he came.
But what if he&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t glad?&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour earlier, when the thought had first come
to her, she had carried a big, square package out to
the table before the kitchen window and untied with
fluttering fingers the string that bound it. The little
scarlet blouse and shimmering skirt, alive with tinsel
that glinted under the light, still lay there beside the
thin-heeled slippers and filmy silk stockings. She
bent over them, patting them lovingly with a slim
hand, her eyes velvety dark while she considered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re pretty&ndash;&ndash;pretty&ndash;&ndash;pretty!&#8221; she said in
a childishly hushed voice, &#8220;the prettiest things in the
world!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next instant she straightened to scan soberly
the old shiny black skirt she was wearing, and the
darned stockings and cracked shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and you would help, I think,&#8221; she went on
musing. &#8220;I know you would, but then&ndash;&ndash;then it
wouldn&#8217;t be <i>me</i>. It would be easy for any one to care
for you&ndash;&ndash;almost too easy. I&ndash;&ndash;I think I&#8217;ll wear them
for him&ndash;&ndash;some other time, maybe&ndash;&ndash;if he wants me
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she turned the very next moment and crossed
to the mirror on the wall&ndash;&ndash;that square bit of glass
before which Young Denny had stood and stared back
into his own eyes and laughed. Oblivious to everything
else she was critically scanning her own small
reflection&ndash;&ndash;great, tip-tilted eyes, violet in the shadow,
and then cheeks and pointed chin&ndash;&ndash;until, even in spite
of her preoccupation, she became aware of the hungry
tremulousness of the mouth of that reflected image&ndash;&ndash;until
the hoarse shriek of an engine&#8217;s whistle leaped
across the valley and brought her up sharp, her breath
going in one long, quavering gasp between wide lips.</p>
<p>It was that moment toward which she had been
straining every hour of those two days; the one from
which she had been shrinking every minute of those
last two hours since dark. She hesitated a second,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
head thrown to one side, listening; she darted into
that dark front room and pressed her face to the cold
pane, and again that warning note came shrilling
across the quiet from the far side of town.</p>
<p>There in the darkness, a hand on either side of the
frame holding her leaning weight, she stood and
waited. Below her the house roofs lay like patches
of jet against the moon-brightness. She stood and
watched its whole length, and no darker figure crept
into relief against its lighter streak of background.
Minutes after she knew that he had had time to come,
and more, she still clung there, staring wide-eyed,
villageward.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a recollection of that half dismantled
wreck of a house under the opposite ridge that finally
drew her dry-lipped gaze from the road; she did not
even think of it that moment. It was simply because
she couldn&#8217;t watch any longer&ndash;&ndash;not even for a minute
or two&ndash;&ndash;that her eyes finally fluttered that way.
But when she did turn there was a bigger, darker blot
there against the leaning picket fence&ndash;&ndash;a big-shouldered
figure that had moved slowly forward until it
stood full in front of the sagging gate.</p>
<p>And even as she watched Denny Bolton swung
around from a long contemplation of that half-torn-down
building to peer up at his own dark place on
the hill&ndash;&ndash;to peer straight back into the eyes of the girl
whom he could not even see.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>She saw the bewilderment in that big body&#8217;s poise;
even at that distance she sensed his dumb, numbed
uncomprehension. From bare white throat to the
mass of tumbled hair that clustered across her forehead
the blood came storming up into her face; and
with the coming of that which set the pulses pounding
in her temples and brought an unaccountable ache to
her throat, all the doubt which had squired her that
day slipped away.</p>
<p>Before he had had time to turn back again she had
flown on mad feet into the kitchen, swept the lamp
from its bracket on the wall with heedless haste and
raced back to that front window. And she placed it
there behind a half-drawn shade&ndash;&ndash;that old signal
which they had agreed upon without one spoken word,
years back.</p>
<p>Crouching in the semi-gloom behind the lamp she
watched.</p>
<p>He stepped forward a pace and stopped; lifted
one hand slowly, as though he did not believe what
he saw. Bareheaded he waited an instant after that
arm went back to his side. When he swung around
and disappeared into the head of the path that led
from the gate into the black shadow of the thicket
in the valley&#8217;s pit she lifted both arms, too, and stood
poised there a moment, slender and straight and
vividly unwavering as the lamp-flame itself, before
she wheeled and ran.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>It was dark in the thick of the underbrush; dark
and velvety quiet, save for the little moon-lit patch
of a clearing where he waited. He stood there in the
middle of that spot of light and heard her coming
long before she reached him&ndash;&ndash;long before he could
see her he heard her scurrying feet and the whip of
bushes against her skirt.</p>
<p>But when she burst through the fringe of brush he
had no time to move or speak, or more than lift his
arms before her swift rush carried her to him. When
her hands flashed up about his neck and her damp
mouth went searching softly across his face and he
strained her nearer and even nearer to him, he felt
her slim body quivering just as it had trembled that
other night when she had raced across the valley to
him&ndash;&ndash;the night when Judge Maynard&#8217;s invitation had
failed to come. After a time he made out the words
that were tumbling from her lips, all incoherent with
half hysterical bits of sobs, and he realized, too, that
her words were like that of that other night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny&ndash;&ndash;Denny,&#8221; she murmured, her small, gold-crowned
head buried in his shoulder. &#8220;I&#8217;m here&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve
come&ndash;&ndash;just as soon as I could; Oh, I&#8217;ve been afraid!
I knew you&#8217;d come, too&ndash;&ndash;I knew you would tonight!
I was sure of it&ndash;&ndash;even when I was sure that you
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time he was silent, because dry lips refused
to frame the words he would have spoken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Minutes he stood and held her against him until the
rise and fall of her narrow shoulders grew quieter,
before he lifted one hand and held her damp face
away, that he might look into it. And gazing back
at him, in spite of all the wordless wonder of her
which she saw glowing in his eyes, she read, too, the
grave perplexity of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you must have known I&#8217;d come,&#8221; he
said, his voice ponderously grave. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I told you so.
I left word for you that I would be back&ndash;&ndash;as soon
as I could come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt her slim body slacken&ndash;&ndash;saw the lightning
change flash over her face which always heralded that
bewildering swift change of mood. It wiped out all
the tenseness of lip and line.</p>
<p>There in the white light in spite of the shadows
of her lashes which turned violet eyes to great pools
of satin shadow, he caught the flare of mischief behind
half-closed lids, before she tilted her head back
and laughed softly, with utter joyous abandon
straight up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he didn&#8217;t deliver it,&#8221; she stated naively.
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault entirely, though, Denny&ndash;&ndash;although
I did give him lots of chances, at first anyway.
I almost made him tell&ndash;&ndash;but he&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s stubborn.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped and laughed again&ndash;&ndash;giggled shamelessly
as she remembered. But her eyes grew grave
once more.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think he didn&#8217;t quite approve of my attitude,&#8221;
she explained to him as he bent over her. &#8220;He
thought I wasn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;sorry enough&ndash;&ndash;to deserve it at
first. And then&ndash;&ndash;and then I never gave him any
opportunity to speak. I would have stopped him if
he had tried. You&ndash;&ndash;you see, I just wanted to&ndash;&ndash;wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Head bowed she paused a moment before she
continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;but I sent him to you&ndash;&ndash;two days ago,
Denny. I sent something that I asked him to give
you&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;when it was over. Didn&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;get
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He fumbled in the pocket of his smooth black
suit after she had disengaged herself and dropped to
the ground at his feet. With her ankles curled up
under her she sat in a boyish heap watching him,
until he drew out the bit of a spangled crimson bow
and held it out before him in the palm of one big
hand. Then he swung down to the ground beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it must have been Old Jerry who
brought it. I didn&#8217;t see him, and no one could remember
his name or knew where he had gone when
they thought to look for him. They&ndash;&ndash;they just
described him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned the bow of silk over, touching it almost
reverently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one gave it to me,&#8221; he continued slowly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly how or when. It&ndash;&ndash;it was just
put into my hand&ndash;&ndash;when I needed it most. I wasn&#8217;t
sure Old Jerry had brought it, but I knew it came
from you, knew it when I didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;know&ndash;&ndash;much&ndash;&ndash;else!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very, very quiet, content merely in his
nearness. Even then she didn&#8217;t understand it&ndash;&ndash;the
reason for his going that night, weeks before&ndash;&ndash;for
the papers which had told her a little had told her
nothing of his brain&#8217;s own reason. The question
was on her lips when her narrow fingers, searching
the shadow for his, found that bandaged wrist and
knuckles. Almost fiercely she drew that hand up
into the light. From the white cloth her gaze went
to the discolored, bruised patches on face and chin&ndash;&ndash;the
same place where that long, ugly cut had been
which dripped blood on the floor the night she had
run from him in the dark&ndash;&ndash;went to his face, and back
again, limpid with pity. And she lifted it impulsively
and tucked it under her chin, and held it there with
small hands that trembled a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;then if you haven&#8217;t seen Old Jerry&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;why
you&ndash;&ndash;he couldn&#8217;t have told you anything
at all yet, about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words trailed off softly and left the statement
hanging interrogatively in midair.</p>
<p>Denny nodded his head in the direction of John
Anderson&#8217;s house that had been.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&#8220;About that?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded her head. And then she told him; she
began at the very beginning and told him everything
from that night when she had watched him there
under cover of the thicket. Once she tried to laugh
when she related Old Jerry&#8217;s panic, a week or two
later, when he had come to find her packing in preparation
to leave. But her mirth was waveringly unsteady.
And when she tried to explain, too, how she
had chanced to buy up the mortgage on his own bleak
house on the hill, her voice again became suddenly,
diffidently small.</p>
<p>There was a new, sweet confusion in her refusal
to meet his eyes and Denny, reaching out with his
bandaged hand, half lifted her and swung her around
until she needs must face him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you mean you&ndash;&ndash;bought it, yourself?&#8221; he
marvelled.</p>
<p>Then, face uplifted, brave-eyed, she went on a little
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought it, myself,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the week you went
away.&#8221; And, in a muffled whisper: &#8220;Denny, I didn&#8217;t
have faith&ndash;&ndash;not much, at first. But I meant to be
here when you did come, just&ndash;&ndash;just because I thought
you might need me&ndash;&ndash;mighty badly. And waiting is
hard, too, when one hasn&#8217;t faith. And I did wait!
That was something, wasn&#8217;t it, Denny? Only&ndash;&ndash;only
now, today, I&ndash;&ndash;I think I realized that my own need
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
of you is greater than yours could ever be for
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat, lips apart, quiet for his answer.</p>
<p>An odd smile edged the boy&#8217;s lips at her wistful
earnestness. It was a twisted little smile which might
have been born of the pain of stinging lids and dryer,
aching throat. He could not have spoken at that moment
had he tried. Instead he lifted her bodily and
drew her huddled little figure into his arms. It was
his first face to face glimpse of the wonder of woman.</p>
<p>But he knew now something which she had only
sensed; he knew that the big, lonesome, bewildered
boy whom she had tried to comfort in his bitterness
that other night when she had hidden her own hurt
disappointment with the white square card within her
breast, had come back all man.</p>
<p>He looked down at her&ndash;&ndash;marvelled at her very
littleness as though it were a thing he had never
known before.</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and you still&ndash;&ndash;would stay?&#8221; he managed to
ask, at last. &#8220;You&#8217;d stay&ndash;&ndash;even if it did mean being
like them,&#8221; he inclined his head toward the distant
village, &#8220;like them, old and wrinkled and worn-out,
before they have half lived their lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her head vehemently against his coat.
He felt her thin arms tighten and tighten about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; she repeated after him in a childishly
small voice. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you see, I <i>know</i> what it is now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
to be alone, even just for a week or two. I think
I&#8217;ll stay, please!&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been a bit of a teasing lilt in her half
smothered words. It disappeared now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d be pretty lonesome, all the rest of my life&ndash;&ndash;man&ndash;&ndash;if
I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>And long afterward she lifted her head from his
arm and blinked at him from sleepy, heavy-lidded
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Denny?&#8221; she asked in drowsy curiosity.
&#8220;Why did you go&ndash;&ndash;why, really? Don&#8217;t you realize
that you haven&#8217;t told me even yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and lifted her to her feet, but that did not
cover the slow flush that stained his face&ndash;&ndash;the old,
vaguely embarrassed flush that she knew so well.
He groped awkwardly for words while he stared
again at the bit of silk in his hand, before his searching
fingers found the thick, crisp packet that had lain
with it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s share of the receipts amounted
to $12,000,&#8221; had been the tale of Morehouse&#8217;s succinct
last paragraph.</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;took me almost two months to save
fifteen dollars,&#8221; Young Denny explained in painful
self-consciousness.</p>
<p>She understood. She remembered the scarlet
blouse and shimmering skirt with its dots of tinsel,
and the stockings and slim-heeled slippers. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
fingers touched his chin&ndash;&ndash;the barest ghost of a caressing
contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny&ndash;&ndash;Denny,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I told you that
night that you didn&#8217;t understand. And yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet
I&#8217;m glad that you couldn&#8217;t. It was for me&ndash;&ndash;you
went. Don&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t you know it was&ndash;&ndash;just because
of you&ndash;&ndash;that I wanted them&ndash;&ndash;at&ndash;&ndash;all?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The circle in the Boltonwood tavern convened early
that night, and long after hope had all but died a
death of stagnation the regulars stuck stubbornly to
their places about the cheerlessly cold, fat-bellied
stove.</p>
<p>It was a session extraordinary, for even Dave Shepard,
the patriarch of the circle itself, could not recall
an occasion when they had foregathered there in such
fashion so long after the last spring snow had surrendered
to summer. Yet it was largely mild-voiced
Dave&#8217;s doing&ndash;&ndash;this silent, sober gathering.</p>
<p>For he alone of all of them had heeded Old Jerry&#8217;s
parting admonition that night, weeks before, when
the servant of the Gov&#8217;mint had turned from his shrill
defiance of the Judge to whip their whole ranks with
scorn. Since then Dave had been following the
papers with faithful and painstaking care&ndash;&ndash;not merely
the political news of the day which invariably furnished
the key for each night&#8217;s debate&ndash;&ndash;but searching
every inch of type, down to the last inconsequential
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
advertisement. And he had been rewarded; he had
penetrated, with the aid of that small picture inset
at the column-head, the disguise of the colorful sobriquet
which Morehouse had fastened upon Young
Denny Bolton. More than that, he had been reading
for weeks each step in that campaign of publicity
which had so harrowed Old Jerry&#8217;s peace of mind&ndash;&ndash;and
somehow he had kept it religiously to himself.</p>
<p>Not until two days before, when Old Jerry&#8217;s desertion
from duty had become a town-wide sensation
had he opened his mouth. The route back in the
hills went mailless that day, and for that reason
there were more than enough papers to go around
when he finally gave the old guard which was waiting
in vain for Old Jerry&#8217;s appearance upon the top step
of the post-office, the benefits of his wider reading.</p>
<p>There had been a fierce factional debate raging
when he came up late to take his unobtrusive place
upon the sidewalk, but even before he added his
voice to the din those who argued that the old mail-carrier&#8217;s
disappearance could be in no way connected
with that of Young Denny Bolton, who had gone the
way of all the others of his line, were in a hopeless
minority.</p>
<p>Their timidest member&#8217;s announcement stunned
them all to silence&ndash;&ndash;left them hushed and speechless&ndash;&ndash;not
for an hour or two, but for the days that
followed as well. Even the red-headlined account
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
which had come with that morning&#8217;s batch of news
of Young Denny&#8217;s victory and the fall of Jed The
Red, whom they had championed under the Judge&#8217;s
able leadership, failed to stir up any really bitter
wrangle.</p>
<p>They sat in an apathetic circle, waiting for Old
Jerry to come.</p>
<p>But no one, not even Morehouse, knew when Old
Jerry disappeared that night after Jed Conway had
come hurtling from his corner, only to lift and whirl
and go crashing back before the impact of The
Pilgrim&#8217;s leaping gloves. At first the plump newspaper
man believed that the surging, shouting wave
of humanity which had broken comber-like over the
ropes to hail a newer favorite had separated the
little, bird-faced man from him. Only a recollection
of those vice-like fingers clinging to his arm a moment
before made that probability seem unbelievable.</p>
<p>It was a long time before The Pilgrim&#8217;s brain
had again become clear enough to grasp the meaning
of the questions which Morehouse put to him,
but Denny did not know even as much as did the
round-faced reporter himself. He only recognized
the description of the shrill voiced, beady-eyed mail
carrier.</p>
<p>To Old Jerry belonged the only comprehensive
explanation for his sudden withdrawal from the
scene, just at that moment when his own share in it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
might have been not inconsequential. And more
than that, his resolution to keep it strictly and privately
his own grew firmer and firmer, the more
thought he gave to it.</p>
<p>In those hours which intervened between the impulse
which had resulted in his modest retreat from
Morehouse&#8217;s side, under cover of the crowd&#8217;s wild
demonstration, and the next morning when he
boarded the train which was to carry him back to
the hills, after a cautious reconnaissance that finally
located Denny in the coach ahead of him, he once
or twice sought to analyze his actions for an explanation
less derogatory to his own self-respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wan&#8217;t no real sense ner reason in my hangin&#8217;
around, jest gittin&#8217; under foot,&#8221; he stated thoughtfully.
&#8220;I done about all I was called on to do, didn&#8217;t
I? Why, I reckon when all&#8217;s said and done, I jest
about won that fight myself! For if I hadn&#8217;t a-come
he wouldn&#8217;t never a-got that ribbon. And Godfrey,
but didn&#8217;t that wake him!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was more than a little satisfaction to be
gained in viewing himself in that light. With less
to occupy his mind and unlimited leisure for elaboration
it could have served as the entire day&#8217;s theme
for thought. But so far as explaining his almost
panic haste to get away the reasoning was palpably
unsatisfactory&ndash;&ndash;so unsatisfactory that he cringed
guiltily behind the back of the seat in front of him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
whenever anyone entered the front door of the car.</p>
<p>He gave quite the entire day to the problem and
long before night hid the flying fences outside his
window he decided that eventually there could be
only one way out of it. Sooner or later he had to
face the issue: he had to tell Young Denny that he
had betrayed his trust. Even that damp wad of bills
which the boy had pressed into his hand, that night
before he left, still burned within his coat.</p>
<p>Once or twice he rose, during the return journey
and advanced with forced jauntiness as far as the
door of the car ahead. But he always stopped there,
after a moment&#8217;s uneasy contemplation of Denny&#8217;s
back, turned a little sadly to the water-cooler, and
returned slowly and unenthusiastically to his seat.
Twice when it was necessary to change trains he
made the transfer with a lightning precision that
would have done honor to any prestidigitator. And
when, hours after nightfall, the train came to a
groaning standstill before Boltonwood&#8217;s deserted
station shed he waited his opportunity and dropped
off in the dark&ndash;&ndash;on the wrong side of the track!</p>
<p>Denny had already become a dark blur ahead of
him when he, too, turned in and took the long road
toward town.</p>
<p>Old Jerry followed the big-shouldered figure that
night with heavily lagging feet&ndash;&ndash;he followed heavy
in spirit and bereft of hope. He was still behind him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
when Denny finally paused before the sagging gate
of John Anderson&#8217;s half-stripped house. Then,
watching the boy&#8217;s dumb lack of understanding, the
enormity of the whole horrible complication dawned
upon him for the first time. He had forgotten Dryad
Anderson&#8217;s going&ndash;&ndash;forgotten that the house upon the
ridge was no longer the property of the man who had
entrusted it to him.</p>
<p>When the light behind that half-drawn shade flared
up, far across on the crest of the opposite hill, and
Young Denny wheeled to plunge into the black mouth
of the path that led deeper into the valley, he too
started swiftly forward. He swept off in desperate
haste up the long hill road that led to the Bolton
homestead.</p>
<p>The light was still there in that front room when
he poked a tentatively inquiring head in at the open
door; he paused in a dull-eyed examination of the
silken garments draped over the table top in the
kitchen after he had roamed vaguely through the
silent house. But he was too tired in mind to give
them much attention just then.</p>
<p>Outside, buried in the shadow of Young Denny&#8217;s
squat, unpainted barn, he still waited doggedly&ndash;&ndash;he
waited ages and ages, a lifetime of apprehension.
And then he saw them coming toward him, up out
of the shadow of the valley into the moonlight that
bathed the hill in silver.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>They paused and stood there&ndash;&ndash;stood and stared
out across the valley at Judge Maynard&#8217;s great box
of a house on the hill and that bit of a wedge-shaped
acre of ruin that clung like an unsightly burr to the
hem of his immaculate pastures.</p>
<p>Slender and boy-like in her little blouse and tight,
short skirt the girl was half-hidden in the hollow of
his shoulder. Once, watching with his head cocked
pertly, sparrowlike, on one side, the old man&#8217;s eyes
went to the white-bandaged knuckles of Denny&#8217;s right
hand; once while he waited Old Jerry saw her lift
her face&ndash;&ndash;saw the big, shoulder-heavy figure fold her
in his arms and bend and touch the glory of her hair
with his lips while she clung to him, before she turned
and went slowly toward the open kitchen door.</p>
<p>Then he started. He shrank farther back into the
shadow and edged a noiseless way around the building.
But with the tavern lights beckoning to him he
waited an introspective moment or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Godfrey &#8217;Lisha,&#8221; he sighed thunderously, &#8220;but
that takes a load offen my mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he ruminated.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the use of my tryin&#8217; to explain now?
What&#8217;s the use&ndash;&ndash;when they ain&#8217;t nothing to explain!
It&#8217;s all come out all right, ain&#8217;t it? Well, then,
hedn&#8217;t I jest as well save my breath?&#8221;</p>
<p>He straightened his thin shoulders and stretched
his arms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t a-been handled much neater, either,&#8221;
that one-sided conversation went on, &#8220;not anyway you
look at it. I always did think that the best thing to
do in them matters was to kinda let &#8217;em take their
own course. And now&ndash;&ndash;now I guess I&#8217;ll be gittin&#8217;
along down!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Before he opened the door of the Tavern office
a scant half hour later, Denny Bolton stopped there
on the steps a moment and, his hand on the latch,
listened to the thin, falsetto voice that came from
within. A slow smile crept up and wrinkled the
corners of the boy&#8217;s eyes after a while when he had
caught the drift of those strident words.</p>
<p>They had been waiting for him&ndash;&ndash;the regulars.
They had been waiting for him longer than Old
Jerry knew. In the chair that had been the throne-seat
of the town&#8217;s great man the servant of the
Gov&#8217;mint sat and faced his loyal circle.</p>
<p>He had reached his climax&ndash;&ndash;had hammered it
home. Now he was rounding out his conclusion for
those who hung, hungry-eyed, upon his eloquence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t begun to do it jestice yet,&#8221; he apologized.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n jest teched on a good many things
that needs to be gone into a trifle. Jest a trifle! It&#8217;ll
take weeks and weeks to do that. But as I was
a-sayin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I got there! I got there just when I was
needed almighty bad. I ain&#8217;t done that part of it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
jestice&ndash;&ndash;but you&#8217;ll see it all in the papers in a day
or two&ndash;&ndash;Sunday supplement, maybe&ndash;&ndash;and pictures&ndash;&ndash;and
colors, too, I reckon!&#8221;</p>
